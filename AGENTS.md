# AGENTS.md

Project-specific guidelines for AI agents working on pgphase.

## Project Overview

pgphase is a C++17/Rust tool for variant calling and haplotype phasing from long reads. It has three commands:

- `collect-bam-variation` — SNP/indel calling from BAM/CRAM alignments
- `collect-graph-variation` — variant calling from pangenome graphs (GBZ + GAF)
- `build-snarl-catalog` — preprocess GBZ graphs into phasing site catalogs

## Build System

- C++17 compiled with GCC, linked against htslib, zlib, pthreads.
- Third-party libraries: WFA2-lib, abPOA, edlib (git submodules under `third_party/`).
- Rust FFI component: `src/gbz_ffi/` (static library linked into the C++ binary).
- Rust tools: `third_party/gbz-base/` (query, gaf2db, gbz2db binaries).
- Build order: `make third-party-libs` → `make gbz-base` → `make -j$(nproc)`.

## Testing

- `make check` — validation gates (requires `test_data/`).
- `make unit-tests` — builds and runs unit test binaries.
- `make window-tests` — Catch2 regression tests over the chr20 gap windows.
  Integration tests: they run the pipeline on real windows (~1.2 s each, ~25 s
  for the panel) and score the output against parental truth, so they need
  `test_data/` and the derived truth map:
  `./scripts/make_truth_hap_map.sh` (once, ~12 s). Without those inputs they
  report a skip naming what is missing rather than failing.

## Architecture Notes

### Two pipelines, shared phasing core

Both pipelines produce a `PhasingChunk` with `CandidateVariant` entries, then share the same k-means phasing and chunk stitching code. The graph pipeline converts snarl site observations into candidates via `build_graph_chunk` in `graph_bam_adapter.cpp`.

### Noise filtering

Reference-based noise detection (homopolymer, tandem repeat, SDUST low-complexity) is shared between pipelines via `noise_filter.hpp/cpp`. The BAM pipeline has additional read-level noise filtering (XID clustering, noisy-reads-ratio, MSA recall) that depends on CIGAR data unavailable in the graph pipeline. See `CHECKPOINT.md` "Noise Filtering: BAM vs Graph Pipeline" for the full rationale.

### Category bitmask system

Candidates are classified with both a `VariantCategory` enum and a `lcd_var_i_to_cate` bitmask. The bitmask controls which candidates enter k-means phasing:

- `kCandGermlineClean` (SNP | Indel | Hom) — used for graph pipeline k-means.
- `kLongcalldRepHetVar` (0x010) — repeat/homopolymer indels, excluded from k-means.
- `kCandGermlineVarCate` — includes noisy-recalled candidates, used in BAM pipeline second k-means.

### Thread safety

`faidx_t` is not thread-safe. Each worker thread opens its own handle via `load_reference_index(opts.ref_fasta)`. The graph pipeline does this in both `process_graph_chunk_batch` and `process_graph_chunk_batch_indexed_gaf`.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Imported from [andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md).

### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## C++ Conventions

Adapted from [XOOS C++ rules](https://github.com/Roche-DIA-RDS-CSI/XOOS).

### Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files | snake_case | `noise_filter.cpp`, `graph_sites.hpp` |
| Variables | snake_case | `ref_beg`, `chunk_rows` |
| Private members | trailing underscore | `loaded_tid_`, `seq_` |
| Functions | snake_case | `find_low_complexity_intervals()` |
| Classes/structs | PascalCase | `GraphSiteMeta`, `PhasingChunk` |
| Constants | kCamelCase | `kSdustThreshold`, `kDefaultNoisyRegMaxXgaps` |
| Namespaces | snake_case | `pgphase_collect` |
| Bitmask flags | kCamelCase | `kCandCleanHetSnp`, `kLongcalldRepHetVar` |

### Header rules

- Use `#ifndef` / `#define` include guards (not `#pragma once`).
- Use `"file.h"` for project-local files.
- All code under `pgphase_collect` namespace.
- Include order: (1) corresponding header, (2) project headers, (3) third-party headers (`sdust.h`, `cgranges.h`), (4) system/htslib headers, (5) standard library.

### Implementation rules

- Implement functions in `.cpp`, not `.hpp` (except templates).
- Const correctness: const parameters, const references, const locals.
- Use RAII for resource management (`std::unique_ptr` with custom deleters for htslib handles).
- No magic numbers — use named `constexpr` constants.
- Prefer `static` file-scope functions over anonymous namespaces for small helpers.
- Match existing style in the file you're editing.

### Error handling

- Use `std::runtime_error` for fatal errors.
- Use `std::cerr` for warnings and verbose output (gated by `opts.verbose`).
- Make error messages actionable — include the file path or parameter that failed.

### Comments

- Explain "why", not "what".
- Use `///` or `/** */` for public API documentation.
- Use `//` for inline implementation notes.
- Do not comment obvious code.

### Testing

- Unit test binaries: `test_graph_sites`, `test_graph_bam_adapter`,
  `test_hybrid_inject`, `test_noise_filter`. Standalone `.cpp` files in `src/`,
  hand-rolled `check()` assertions, no framework. Run all: `make unit-tests`.
- Injection tests: `src/test_bam_site_injection.cpp`, three Catch2 cases over
  the same panel -- completeness (every alignment-channel site reaches the
  hybrid), representation (shared sites keep their alleles, no second
  description added) and counts (internally consistent, and within the reads
  overlapping the site). Known unfixed defects are listed in
  `src/test_bam_site_injection_allow.tsv` and the tests gate on "no new ones";
  the mechanism of each is in `evaluations/2026-09-17-injection-tests/`.
- Window regression tests: `src/test_gap_windows.cpp`, built against the
  vendored Catch2 single header in `third_party/catch2/`. One test case per arm
  and window over the committed panel
  (`evaluations/2026-09-16-test-panel/panel.tsv`), asserting spanning, in-gap
  phased heterozygotes, tagged reads, read concordance and the absolute
  discordant count against `src/test_gap_windows_expect.tsv`.
  Run: `make window-tests`.
- The expectations are floors and ceilings, except `spans`, which is asserted
  exactly in both directions: a span appearing where none is expected is a join
  across an interval no read crosses, not an improvement. Regenerate with
  `./scripts/refresh_gap_window_expectations.sh` only when an improvement is
  intended, and say in the commit which arm moved — refreshing the file to turn
  a red test green is how a regression gets committed.
- When adding a new `.o` dependency, update both the main `pgphase` target and any test targets that link the dependent object.

## Shell Script Conventions

- Start every script with `set -euo pipefail`.
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Quote all variable expansions: `"${var}"`.
- Use `readonly` for constants.
- Provide `--help` / usage output.
- Use `die()` or similar for fatal errors with exit code 1.

---

## Git Conventions

- Commit messages: imperative mood, first line ≤72 chars, blank line before body.
- Add co-author: `Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>`.
- Only stage files relevant to the current task.
- Do not commit files modified before the task began unless directly related.

---

## Design Decisions Log

All significant design decisions, evaluation results, and filtering rationale are recorded in `CHECKPOINT.md`. Update it when:

- Adding or removing a filtering stage.
- Changing how a pipeline classifies or handles candidates.
- Running evaluation benchmarks with new results.
- Discovering pitfalls or gotchas worth preserving.

## Documentation

`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` is the single living description of how the code works.
**A commit that changes behaviour updates it in the same commit.** Part I is
current behaviour and is authoritative; Part II is per-component detail carrying
its own revision date.

Measurements, findings and history do NOT go there -- they go in `evaluations/`
by date and in `CHECKPOINT.md`. Keeping them out is what lets the implementation
doc be trusted without checking its date. `docs/HANDOFF.md`,
`docs/hybrid_design.md` and `docs/phase_graph_implementation.md` are history and
say so in their own banners.
