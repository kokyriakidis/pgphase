# pgphase implementation

The single living description of how pgphase works. **Change the implementation,
update this file in the same commit** -- that is the whole point of it being one
file.

What belongs here: how the code behaves today. What does not: measurements,
history, retracted findings, plans. Those live in `evaluations/` by date, in
`CHECKPOINT.md`, and in `docs/HANDOFF.md`; keeping them out is what lets this
file be trusted without a date check.

**Precedence.** Part I is current and authoritative. Part II is deep
per-component detail carrying the date it was last revised; where it disagrees
with Part I, Part I is right and Part II is stale.

## Part I -- current behaviour

### The four subcommands

`pgphase --help` registers exactly these:

| command | what it is |
|---|---|
| `collect-bam-variation` | the alignment arm: candidates and phasing from a BAM alone |
| `collect-graph-variation` | the catalog's sites phased from GAF evidence; `--bam` adds gap recovery |
| `collect-hybrid-variation` | BAM calling plus graph read augmentation, described in this Part |
| `build-snarl-catalog` | preprocesses a GBZ graph into the phasing site catalog the other two consume |

`phase-graph` is **not** among them: it was an earlier subcommand, removed, and
the machinery it described now lives in `graph_bam_adapter.cpp` behind
`collect-graph-variation`. Its old description is kept as history in
`docs/phase_graph_implementation.md`.


---

One mode: **the catalog's sites phase, the alignment recovers the gaps.** There
is no configuration that selects a different architecture.

```
pgphase collect-hybrid-variation \
  --ref chm13.fa --bam reads.bam \
  --graph-sites sites.vcf.gz --gaf reads.coord.gaf.gz \
  -r 'CHM13#0#chr20' -o candidates.tsv --phased-vcf-out phased.vcf -b phased.bam
```

### Per chunk, in order

| step | call | what it contributes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `load_and_prepare_chunk` | reads and their digars. Loads down to `min(min_mapq, recovery_min_mapq)`; anything below `min_mapq` is parsed and immediately marked skipped, so every stage behaves as if it were absent |
| 2 | `collect_var_classify` | alignment discovery, allele counts, the **noisy-region model**, classification |
| 3 | *(withhold)* | `chunk.candidates.clear()` -- the alignment channel's own candidates do not enter the first solve |
| 4 | `load_sites_for_region` → `inject_graph_sites` | the catalog's sites become the candidate table. These are the phasing anchors |
| 5 | `collect_var_build_profiles` | each read's allele at each candidate it overlaps |
| 6 | `inject_graph_reads` | GAF-derived observations for reads the alignment does not carry |
| 7 | `backfill_graph_candidate_counts` | derives every count on a graph-only candidate from the final profile state. The single writer, so double counting is inexpressible |
| 8 | `classify_graph_only_candidates` → `apply_hybrid_noise_filter` | category per injected candidate, then the indel noise screen |
| 9 | `collect_var_run_phasing` | the clean k-means plus the noisy-region MSA. The hybrid's own `skip_noisy_kmeans` keeps the noisy class out of this solve |
| 10 | **recovery** | below |
| 11 | `prune_not_candidate_variants` | drop what no longer qualifies |

Then `stitch_chunk_haps` joins adjacent chunks on shared reads, the read filters
run, and the outputs are written.

### Why step 2 survives step 3

Step 3 discards the candidates step 2 produced, which makes the discovery look
like dead cost. It is not: `chunk.noisy_regions` is derived from those
candidates, that model scopes the noisy-region MSA, and the MSA supplies most of
a chunk's phased sites. Skipping discovery outright on
`chr20:25,979,591-26,138,679` is 31% faster (4.05 s to 2.78 s) and collapses
phased heterozygotes from **447 to 137**.

### Recovery (step 10), on by default

Two failure modes, because they do not overlap:

- `collect_unphased_windows` -- intervals where the solve left **reads**
  unphased, which is what an alignment-driven solve produces;
- `collect_block_seams` -- intervals between consecutive blocks, every read
  placed but the blocks unjoined, which is what a catalog-driven solve produces.

Each window is treated twice, in order:

1. **In place.** The chunk is re-solved with `force_noisy_msa` (asks for the
   noisy-region MSA by name, and enables `split_nested_msa_deletions` with it),
   `skip_noisy_kmeans = false` (so the recalled sites are actually oriented), and
   `retry_windows` as the **only** scoping -- it confines the widened het
   admission to the failed intervals. Admitting that class chunk-wide instead
   roughly doubled the chromosome-wide read Hamming error (0.878% → 1.837%).
2. **As its own chunk.** Whatever is still unphased, plus the seams, goes to
   `recover_windows_with_targeted_solve`: `process_chunk` over the window plus
   one read length at the recovery mapq floor, with the noisy class admitted and
   no further recursion. The result is stitched to each adjacent parent block by
   `select_stitch_orientation` over the reads tagged in both -- which refuses
   when no read is shared, so an interval no read crosses yields two honest
   blocks instead of a coin flip. Sites the parent holds unphased **adopt** the
   sub-solve's phasing; sites it never discovered are **imported**.

### How the arms relate

`collect-bam-variation` and `collect-graph-variation` are separate tools, not
modes of the hybrid. They are what the hybrid is measured against; neither takes
the other's input.

### What is not a mode

`--no-retry-unphased-with-bam` disables recovery and exists for regression
attribution, not as a supported configuration. Everything else on the hybrid is
a threshold or an output path. Removed as modes: `--recover-gaps`,
`--msa-verified-refine`, `--gap-bam-only`, `--graph-first`/`--no-graph-first`,
`--graph-authoritative`, `--private-sites` and `--bam-authoritative-bed`.

### The graph arm with `--bam`

`collect-graph-variation --bam` is the arm under active work, and it is not the
hybrid: the catalog's sites are phased from GAF evidence, and the alignment is
consulted ONLY to recover what those sites could not join.

```
pgphase collect-graph-variation \
  --ref chm13.fa --sites sites.vcf.gz --gaf reads.coord.gaf.gz --bam reads.bam \
  -r 'CHM13#0#chr20' -o candidates.tsv \
  --phased-vcf-out phased.vcf --phased-bam-out phased.bam
```

Two recovery placements, and they are a real choice:

| | where | flag |
|---|---|---|
| post-hoc (default) | after the pass, as its own sub-solve grafted onto the parent blocks | -- |
| in-chunk | inside each chunk, before the stitch | `--in-chunk-recovery` |

In-chunk recovery merges the alignment's in-gap candidates into the LIVE chunk
and re-runs both solve rounds over the union, so the recovered sites are ordinary
members of the chunk's own solve rather than a graft whose internal parity
nothing checks. `--no-anchored-stage2` makes stage 2 reset and re-solve over the
wider site set instead of refining stage 1; on this path the resetting form
measures better, which is the reverse of the alignment arm and is not explained.

chr20 at `-t 16`, scored against read-level parental truth:

| | wall | tagged | read blocks | discordant | read hamming | VCF records | phased | hom |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| post-hoc | -- | 203,751 | 281 | 2,732 | 1.341% | 56,032 | 55,907 | 125 |
| in-chunk, `--no-anchored-stage2` | 114 s | 219,059 | 323 | **2,543** | **1.161%** | 61,789 | **61,650** | 139 |

#### What the merge must preserve

Mutating a live chunk means restoring every property the rest of the pass
assumes, and six defects shipped because nothing checked them.
`verify_chunk_invariants` (`collect_phase.cpp`) runs at the end of the merge and
throws, naming the first violation:

- the three per-site arrays (`site_ids`, `site_meta`, `site_allele_orig_idx`) as
  long as `candidates` -- the writer addresses metadata BY CANDIDATE INDEX;
- `read_var_profile`, `haps` and `phase_sets` as long as `reads`;
- `candidates` position-sorted, and `read_var_profile[i].read_id == i`;
- `reads` qname-sorted -- the cross-chunk stitch pairs them with a merge-join,
  so one inversion makes it skip everything past that point;
- the re-solved region inside `[chunk.ref_beg, chunk.ref_end]` -- discovering
  outside pulls in the neighbour's reads, which then enter the stitch's vote.

#### What a merged site contributes

A merged site takes part in the solve like any other, but it is WRITTEN only
when this writer's own classification (`graph_collect.cpp:196-223`, which
reclassifies from depth) calls it a het. Two reasons: the alignment's in-gap
discovery also calls homozygous variants, and a merged candidate often carries
`ref_cov = 0`, which that reclassification reads as homozygous. Emitting either
would add calls that appear only inside recovery windows -- a biased subset of
the genome -- to a VCF whose contract is the catalog's sites plus what recovery
phased.

Four phase sets chromosome-wide still tag reads without a record describing
them. Their sites are merged candidates the writer classifies LOW_COV or LOW_AF;
withholding those at admission removes three of the four and costs 11 blocks of
contiguity and 14 more misplaced reads, so they are left in deliberately.

### Test gates

`make unit-tests` (4 binaries), `make window-tests` (the committed chr20 gap
windows) and `make predicate-tests` (the phasing predicates and the chunk
invariants). All three must pass before a commit.

There is no injection suite: `src/test_bam_site_injection.cpp` was deleted in
c092785 when the tests were narrowed to the window under work. A compiled binary
outlived it in some working trees and kept printing pass/fail counts from
retired expectations; it is not a build target and its output means nothing.

## Part II -- component reference

### Chapter A -- `collect-bam-variation` (alignment arm)

*Last revised 2026-09-18.* An architecture description, file by file. It cites longcallD
symbols for parity, so names like `flip_variant_hap` or `collect_cand_vars` are
upstream's and are expected to be absent from `src/`. Two deliberate divergences
post-date it: the homopolymer detector was fixed in 510f865 (its insertion
branch compared a raw reference byte against an nt4 code, so it never fired --
upstream has the same defect), and stage 2 refines stage 1 rather than resetting
since 0cd9e7f. The repeat/homopolymer predicates it describes exist in several
copies across the sources, tracked as a consolidation item.

This document describes the implementation of the `pgphase collect-bam-variation` command from command-line input to final candidate output. The goal of this command is to collect and classify germline, non-mosaic candidate variation from one or more indexed BAM/CRAM files, then emit longcallD-parity projected VCF outputs (`--vcf-output`, `--phased-vcf-output`) from that internal state. The primary internal surface is still a structured candidate table (TSV) with read-level support counts, strand tallies, and quality categories aligned with longcallD’s candidate stage; this table is intended for downstream analysis and parity checks. After initial classification, each chunk runs longcallD-shaped **read profiling** and **k-means haplotype clustering** (§18), then longcallD Step 4-style noisy-region MSA recall and a follow-up germline-var-category k-means update (Step 4 subsection in §18). Adjacent chunks are stitched (§19) to merge phase blocks across boundaries.

The implementation is organized as a **staged pipeline** so that memory stays bounded on whole-genome runs and so each stage has a clear responsibility:

- **`collect_pipeline.cpp`** — End-to-end orchestration: parse regions and BED, build `RegionChunk` tiles with neighbour metadata (`reg_chunk_i`, prev/next overlap hints), stream batches to disk through `run_collect_bam_variation`, and expose the `collect_bam_variation` CLI wrapper. This is the “control plane” of the tool.
- **`collect_var.cpp`** — The “biology core” ported from longcallD: gather candidate keys from digars, sweep reads for allele depths, then merge and filter chunk-level noisy regions (`cgranges`, `pre_process_noisy_regs_pgphase` timing), run Fisher strand bias in ONT mode, run the two-pass `classify_cand_vars`-shaped classification, and build read-level allele profiles (`collect_read_var_profile`). It calls k-means phasing, but the implementation of `assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans` lives in `collect_phase.cpp`.
- **`bam_digar.cpp`** — The “alignment plane”: stream BAM/CRAM into `ReadRecord` rows, apply read filters, build digars from EQX / MD / `cs` / reference comparison, and detect **per-read** noisy intervals using the same sliding-window rule as longcallD (see §8).
- **`collect_output.cpp`** — Serializers only: TSV header/body, optional projected VCF and projected phased VCF (longcallD-style FILTER/INFO/category gates), optional read×site read-support TSV, optional phase-read TSV, and optional phased alignment output helpers. No classification logic lives here.
- **`collect_phase.cpp` / `collect_phase.hpp`** — K-means read–haplotype clustering (`assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans`), ported from longcallD `assign_hap.c`; category bitmask flags (`kCandCleanHetSnp`, …) for selecting which `VariantCategory` values participate in phasing; chunk-boundary stitching (`stitch_chunk_haps` / `flip_chunk_hap`) with common-read voting as the primary path.
- **`collect_phase_pgbam.cpp` / `collect_phase_pgbam.hpp`** — Annotated-BAM/`.pgbam` phase-block stitching: parses `hs` BAM tags, maps sidecar set IDs to graph thread IDs, merges phase blocks within chunks, and provides fallback adjacent-chunk stitching when `flip_chunk_hap` cannot apply a common-read stitch (§19.7).
- **`collect_types.hpp`** — Shared structs (`Options`, `BamChunk`, `ReadRecord`, `CandidateVariant`, `ReadVariantProfile`, per-read `haps` / `phase_sets`, `PgbamSidecarData`, …) and small RAII helpers (`SamFile`, `ReferenceCache`, HTS deleters).

Together, these files implement “longcallD-shaped” candidate collection in C++17 with explicit streaming and multi-BAM pooling.

###### Reading guide and conventions

This document is organized in execution order. Sections `§1`–`§23` describe algorithmic stages and output
contracts; `§24`–`§28` provide reproducibility, boundary, parity-log, and runtime guard material.

Coordinate conventions used throughout:

- Genomic intervals in pipeline state are primarily **1-based inclusive**.
- `htslib`/`cgranges` operations are **0-based half-open** and are converted at boundaries.
- Indels follow VCF anchor semantics (`sort_pos = pos - 1` for insertions/deletions).

Representation conventions used throughout:

- Candidate TSV is the internal explanatory surface for retained candidate categories. LongcallD-not-candidate categories (`NON_VAR`, `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`) are pruned before emission.
- Optional VCF/phased VCF outputs are projected call surfaces (category/depth gated).
- Same-position multi-allelic behavior is represented as multiple biallelic records when alleles survive gates.

###### Source documentation (Doxygen)

The `collect_*` sources and headers are written for **Doxygen-style** extraction:

- Each major `.cpp` begins with an `@file` / `@brief` (and sometimes `@details`) block describing scope and conventions.
- Public and internal helpers use `@brief`, `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, and `@note` where that clarifies contracts (for example, which functions reopen the BAM for SQ names, or when `std::runtime_error` is thrown on I/O failure).
- Header files (`collect_pipeline.hpp`, `collect_var.hpp`, `collect_output.hpp`, `collect_types.hpp`) duplicate or summarize API intent so a reader browsing headers alone sees the same contracts as the implementation.

HTML generation is optional; the comments are designed to remain readable directly in the IDE.

###### Vendored `cgranges` (longcallD fork, not vanilla lh3)

The project ships **`src/cgranges.c`** and **`src/cgranges.h`** as **vendored** sources (they live in-repo, not as a git submodule). For the current longcallD `main` branch on GitHub, these files are **byte-identical** to longcallD’s `src/cgranges.*`.

They are **not** the same as the minimal upstream library [lh3/cgranges](https://github.com/lh3/cgranges) alone: longcallD’s copy adds APIs this pipeline relies on, including:

- **`cr_merge` / `cr_merge2`** — merge nearby intervals with fixed and dynamic distance parameters (noisy-region geometry after extension).
- **`cr_is_contained`** — test whether a query span is fully covered by some stored interval (final containment filter for candidates inside noisy blocks).

**Why vendored instead of a submodule?** A plain clone plus `make` remains sufficient; the exact C snapshot stays pinned to the validated longcallD revision; and release tarballs do not depend on recursive submodule checkout. If longcallD updates `cgranges` upstream, this tree is refreshed intentionally (diff + test) rather than floating on a submodule pointer.

```

##### 1. Command-Line Configuration

The command is invoked as:

```text
pgphase collect-bam-variation [options] <ref.fa> <input.bam|bam.list> [region ...]
```

The command-line parser builds an `Options` object. Important defaults are:

```text
threads = 1
min_mapq = 30
min_bq = 10
min_depth = 5
min_alt_depth = 2
min_af = 0.20
max_af = 0.80
chunk_size = 500000
max_var_ratio_per_read = 0.05
max_noisy_frac_per_read = 0.5
noisy_reg_merge_dis = 500
min_sv_len = 30
noisy_reg_max_xgaps = 5
min_noisy_reg_total_depth = 0 (0 = no extra minimum on overlapping reads; use 5 for the published “total coverage” rule)
verbose = 0 (use 2 for longcallD style AllNoisyRegions output)
HiFi noisy slide window = 100 bp
ONT noisy slide window = 25 bp
short-read noisy slide window = 25 bp
ONT strand-bias p-value threshold = 0.01
```

The input can be a single BAM/CRAM, a list of BAM/CRAM files, or a primary BAM/CRAM plus extra BAM/CRAM files:

```text
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa sample.bam
pgphase collect-bam-variation --input-is-list ref.fa bam_list.txt
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa part1.bam -X part2.bam -X part3.bam
```

Multiple input BAM/CRAM files are treated as files from the same sample. For each genomic chunk, reads from all input files are loaded and pooled before candidate collection. This means the candidate table represents the combined evidence of the sample, not independent per-file calls.

Two option semantics require explicit clarification:

```text
--include-filtered
  controls whether BAM reads marked QC-fail or duplicate are loaded.
  It does not mean "include filtered candidate categories in the output";
  candidate-category pruning follows the longcallD-shaped pipeline.

--hifi
  selects HiFi-oriented behavior: a 100 bp default noisy-read window. Like
  longcallD `classify_var_cate`, the Fisher / strand-bias test is not applied
  in non-ONT modes. This is the default if no read technology flag is supplied.

--ont
  selects ONT-oriented behavior: a 25 bp default noisy-read window and
  Fisher exact testing for alternate-strand imbalance (longcallD
  `var_is_strand_bias` / `classify_var_cate`).

--short-reads
  selects short-read behavior: a 25 bp default noisy-read window. Strand-bias
  classification is ONT-only, same as longcallD: HiFi/short modes do not run
  the Fisher strand test.

Only one of --hifi, --ont, and --short-reads may be supplied.

--pgbam-file FILE
  Optional path to a pgbam sidecar (.pgbam). When supplied, annotated-BAM `hs`
  tags plus sidecar graph-thread mappings are used after regular per-chunk
  k-means phasing: first to merge phase blocks within each chunk, then as a
  fallback for adjacent chunk boundaries where common-read voting has no
  decisive signal. Has no effect when absent.

--pgbam-primary-margin INT / --pgbam-primary-min-winning INT
  Control the primary pgbam scorer used by within-chunk pgbam stitching and
  adjacent-chunk pgbam fallback. Defaults are margin 2 and minimum winner 2.

--no-pgbam-cleanup-pass / --pgbam-cleanup-margin INT / --pgbam-cleanup-min-winning INT
  Control the first final contig-level pgbam cleanup pass. Defaults are enabled,
  margin 2, and minimum winner 1.

--no-pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-pass / --pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-margin INT / --pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-min-winning INT
  Control the second final contig-level pgbam cleanup pass. Defaults are enabled,
  margin 1, and minimum winner 1.
```

The command supports explicit region restriction:

```text
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa sample.bam chr11:1000-2000
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa sample.bam -r chr11:1000-2000 -r chr12:1-500
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa sample.bam --region-file regions.bed
pgphase collect-bam-variation ref.fa sample.bam --autosome
```

Region arguments are parsed as 1-based inclusive intervals. BED intervals are converted from 0-based half-open BED coordinates to 1-based inclusive coordinates by adding one to the BED start and keeping the BED end as the inclusive end.

Internally, most genomic positions stored in `RegionChunk`, `VariantKey`, `DigarOp`, `ReadRecord`, and `Interval` are 1-based inclusive coordinates. HTSlib iterator calls and the `cgranges` interval library use 0-based half-open intervals, so the code converts at the boundary:

```text
1-based inclusive interval: chr11:1001-1100
HTSlib/cgranges interval:   start = 1000, end = 1100
```

Insertions use the longcallD convention: an insertion at position `P` is between `P - 1` and `P`. This is why insertion interval operations often use `[P - 1, P)` in 0-based half-open form.

##### 2. Reference and Alignment Resource Setup

Reference FASTA loading uses HTSlib's `fai_load3` with index creation enabled. This supports ordinary local FASTA files and remote FASTA paths supported by HTSlib. The `ReferenceCache` object fetches and caches one contig sequence at a time, normalizing bases to `A`, `C`, `G`, `T`, or `N`.

Each BAM/CRAM is opened through `SamFile`, which validates that the file format is BAM or CRAM. For CRAM input, the reference FASTA path is provided to HTSlib through `hts_set_fai_filename`, allowing CRAM decoding to retrieve reference bases.

For each worker thread, `WorkerContext` opens all input alignment files, reads their headers, loads their indexes, and owns a shared reference cache for that worker. This avoids sharing HTSlib file handles across worker threads.

Example:

```text
Input files:
  part1.bam
  part2.bam

Worker 1 opens:
  part1.bam + index
  part2.bam + index
  reference FASTA index

Worker 2 opens:
  part1.bam + index
  part2.bam + index
  reference FASTA index
```

This design enables parallel chunk processing while maintaining independent HTSlib state per worker.

##### 3. Region and Chunk Construction

The pipeline first determines which genomic regions to process.

If the user supplied regions, a BED file, or `--autosome`, those filters are used. If no region filter is supplied, every contig present in both the BAM header and the FASTA index is processed.

The `--autosome` option checks chromosomes `1` through `22`. For each chromosome number, it first looks for a `chr`-prefixed contig such as `chr11`; if that is absent, it looks for the unprefixed form such as `11`. A chromosome is used only if it is present in both the BAM header and the FASTA index.

Each region is split into fixed-size chunks. The default chunk size is `500000` bp, configurable with `--chunk-size`.

Example:

```text
Requested region:
  chr11:1-1,200,000

With default chunk_size = 500000:
  chunk 1: chr11:1-500000
  chunk 2: chr11:500001-1000000
  chunk 3: chr11:1000001-1200000
```

Chunking provides two benefits. First, it limits read and candidate state held in memory at one time. Second, it creates independent work units for parallel processing.

Reads can span chunk boundaries. Because each chunk queries reads overlapping that chunk, a long read may be loaded for two adjacent chunks. Candidate collection is still restricted to Digar events inside the current chunk boundaries. This means a boundary-spanning read can contribute evidence to candidates on both sides, while each chunk only creates candidate sites for its own interval. Fuzzy large-insertion deduplication runs **only inside each chunk** (longcallD `collect_all_cand_var_sites`); batch output does not run a second contig-wide fuzzy collapse, so near-boundary fuzzy duplicates across chunks are not merged by insertion similarity (same as longcallD).

##### 4. Parallel Chunk Processing and Streaming Output

The central orchestrator is `run_collect_bam_variation` (`collect_pipeline.cpp`). It **streams** results to disk so the full merged candidate table for an entire genome need not sit in memory at once. The streaming loop groups chunks by `reg_chunk_i`, runs a thread pool over each group, stitches phase state, exact-site merges candidates within the batch, and appends to open output streams—so peak RAM scales with **one contig’s batch** plus worker scratch space, not with every variant on the genome. For readers navigating the code, `collect_pipeline.cpp` / `.hpp` document each step (`load_region_chunks`, `collect_chunk_batch_parallel`, CLI parsing) with Doxygen-style comments.

High-level flow:

```text
collect_bam_variation(argc, argv) parses CLI options
run_collect_bam_variation(opts) starts streaming execution
load reference index (FAI)
build sorted RegionChunk list (`annotate_chunk_neighbors`: chunk_id, reg_chunk_i, prev/next overlaps)
open TSV (and optional VCF / phased VCF / read-support / phase-read / phased alignment) streams; write headers
for each batch of consecutive chunks sharing the same reg_chunk_i:
    run collect_chunk_batch_parallel (atomic chunk claiming within the batch)
    stitch_chunk_haps(batch.chunks, &opts, sidecar.get())
    merge_chunk_candidates(batch.chunks) → exact-site merge, active-region-passing duplicate preferred
    append write_variants_tsv_records (and optional VCF / phased VCF / read-support / phase-read / alignment rows)
close streams; coordinate-sort refined alignment output if requested; index BAM/CRAM output; print summary counts
```

**`reg_chunk_i` batches:** After `annotate_chunk_neighbors`, every chunk on the same reference sequence (contig) shares one `reg_chunk_i`; the batch loop processes **all chunks of one contig** together, stitches phase state, merges exact duplicate candidate keys, and appends. If the user supplies multiple disjoint region filters on different chromosomes, chunk order is sorted by contig and start, so each contig’s chunks still form their own batch. Batching is for streaming I/O and ordering; it does **not** re-run fuzzy collapse across chunks (longcallD parity).

**Workers:** Inside a batch, each worker owns a `WorkerContext`, claims the next chunk index with `fetch_add`, runs `process_chunk` (load reads → full per-chunk `collect_var_main` workflow: sites, allele counts, noisy prep, classification, noisy post-process/containment/pruning, read profiling, k-means, Step 4 noisy MSA recall), and stores a `BamChunk` in a **fixed offset** so completion order does not scramble indices.

**`collect_chunks_parallel`:** A small helper still exists for “all chunks in one shot” (e.g. tests); the default CLI path uses the streaming loop above. It calls `stitch_chunk_haps(..., nullptr)`, so CLI-only `--pgbam-file` sidecar stitching is not active through this helper.

Example (same contig, five chunks, two threads inside one batch):

```text
Chunks on chr11 (same reg_chunk_i): C0, C1, C2, C3, C4

Workers steal indices until the batch is done:
  worker may process C0, C2, C4 / C1, C3 (order of claiming varies)

Merge for this batch:
  candidates(C0) ∥ … ∥ candidates(C4)
      → exact-site merge, active-region-passing duplicate preferred
      → append to TSV (each Ci already fuzzy-collapsed internally)
```

##### 5. Read Loading for a Chunk

For each chunk, the pipeline loads reads from every input BAM/CRAM using the BAM/CRAM index. The iterator query uses the chunk's contig id and half-open HTSlib coordinates:

```text
chunk: chr11:100001-200000
HTSlib query: tid(chr11), start=100000, end=200000
```

Each alignment record is filtered before conversion:

```text
discard if unmapped
discard if secondary
discard if supplementary
discard if MAPQ < min_mapq
discard QC-fail or duplicate unless --include-filtered is set
```

The exclusion of supplementary alignments is important. Many DNA structural-variant aligners represent split-read evidence using supplementary records and `SA` tags. This candidate collector intentionally does not assemble split alignments at this stage; it collects SNPs and indels from each primary alignment record's local alignment representation. Reference skips (`N` CIGAR operations) are also not treated as deletions.

For each accepted alignment, the code stores a `ReadRecord` with (among others):

```text
reference contig id
input BAM index (multi-input pooling)
1-based alignment start and end
strand
NM tag value if present
mapping quality
query name
base qualities (copy)
duplicate of the BAM alignment (bam1_t) for downstream use
Digar operations
read-level noisy regions
ONT palindrome flag, overlap-skip bookkeeping, phasing placeholders (haps, phase_sets, …)
read skip status
```

After loading reads from all input files, reads are sorted by:

```text
alignment start (ascending)
alignment end (descending — longer span first when start matches)
NM tag (ascending)
query name (ascending)
```

This deterministic sorting makes output stable across thread counts and input iteration details.

When more than one BAM/CRAM is provided, this sorting happens after reads from all inputs have been pooled for the chunk. The candidate collector therefore sees a single read collection per chunk:

```text
chunk reads = reads_from_part1 + reads_from_part2 + ... + reads_from_partN
sort pooled reads deterministically
process pooled reads once
```

##### 6. Digar Construction

A `DigarOp` is the internal representation of an alignment event. It records:

```text
reference position
operation type
operation length
query/read position
low-quality flag
alternate sequence for SNPs and insertions
```

The supported Digar types are:

```text
Equal      aligned match block
Snp        single-base mismatch
Insertion  inserted read sequence relative to reference
Deletion   deleted reference sequence relative to read
SoftClip   soft-clipped read sequence
HardClip   hard-clipped read sequence
RefSkip    CIGAR N reference skip, e.g. spliced RNA alignment
```

The code can build Digars from several alignment encodings:

```text
1. EQX CIGAR if the CIGAR uses = and X without M
2. cs tag if present
3. MD tag if present
4. reference comparison fallback for M CIGAR operations
```

This priority matters because different aligners encode mismatches differently. If a `cs` or `MD` path fails to parse safely, the code falls back to reference comparison.

The parser priority also preserves information when the aligner has already emitted explicit mismatch operations. For example, an EQX CIGAR has separate `=` and `X` operations, so a mismatch can be emitted without comparing every aligned base to the reference. If only ordinary `M` operations are available, the implementation needs either a `cs` tag, an `MD` tag, or the reference sequence to determine which aligned bases are matches versus SNPs.

Adjacent `Equal` Digars are merged to keep match runs compact. Adjacent insertions and deletions are deliberately not coalesced in the generic append path, because longcallD keeps those events separate in its CIGAR/MD-derived representation. Preserving this behavior keeps candidate sorting and large-insertion collapsing compatible with longcallD.

Examples of tag-derived parsing:

```text
MD tag example:
  CIGAR: 10M
  MD:    4A5

Interpretation:
  4 matching reference bases
  1 mismatch where the reference base is A
  5 matching reference bases

The read base at the mismatch position becomes the SNP alternate allele.
```

```text
cs tag example:
  cs: :4*ag:5

Interpretation:
  :4    four matches
  *ag   reference a, query g, therefore SNP alt G
  :5    five matches
```

For insertions and deletions, the `cs` tag uses:

```text
+ACG  insertion of ACG in the read
-TTA  deletion of TTA from the reference
```

The code still checks the CIGAR and read coordinates while parsing these tags, because the tag must be projected onto the read and reference positions.

###### 6.1 Example: SNP from Reference Comparison

Suppose the reference and read are:

```text
Reference: A C G T A
Read:      A C T T A
                 ^
```

At the third base, the reference has `G` and the read has `T`. The Digar emitted is:

```text
type = Snp
pos = reference position of G
len = 1
alt = "T"
low_quality = base_quality(T) < min_bq
```

If the base quality is at least `min_bq`, this SNP also contributes one unit to the read-level noisy-event sliding window.

For SNPs, low quality is determined from the base quality of the read base carrying the alternate allele.

###### 6.2 Example: Insertion

CIGAR:

```text
10M3I20M
```

If the insertion occurs after reference position `1009` and the inserted read bases are `TGA`, the internal representation is:

```text
type = Insertion
pos = 1010
ref_len = 0
alt = "TGA"
```

Insertions use the position convention inherited from longcallD: an insertion at `pos` is between `pos - 1` and `pos`. The inserted sequence is stored as the alternate allele.

An insertion is marked low-quality only if all inserted bases have quality below `min_bq`. If at least one inserted base meets the base-quality threshold, the insertion Digar is not marked low-quality at construction time.

###### 6.3 Example: Deletion

CIGAR:

```text
10M4D20M
```

If the deletion starts at reference position `1010`, the Digar is:

```text
type = Deletion
pos = 1010
ref_len = 4
alt = ""
```

The deleted reference sequence is not stored in the `VariantKey`; it is fetched later from the reference when TSV or VCF output is written.

A deletion has no read bases inside the deleted reference interval. Therefore its low-quality check uses the qualities of the read bases flanking the deletion. The deletion is treated as high-quality only when the left and right anchors are available and pass the base-quality threshold, with special handling at the start or end of the read.

###### 6.4 Example: Reference Skip

CIGAR:

```text
50M1000N50M
```

The `N` operation means the alignment skips `1000` reference bases without consuming read bases. This is common in spliced RNA alignments and is not treated as a deletion candidate. It is stored as `RefSkip`, which prevents it from being counted as a genomic deletion.

The difference between deletion and reference skip is:

```text
D: consumes reference bases and represents missing sequence in the read
N: consumes reference bases but represents an alignment jump, usually a splice gap
```

Only deletions become deletion candidates. Reference skips are ignored by candidate collection.

##### 7. Per-Read Quality and Skip Decisions

After Digars are built, the read is checked for excessive variation or excessive noisy-region coverage.

The first skip rule is based on the density of candidate events:

```text
total_cand_events > mapped_length * max_var_ratio_per_read
```

With the default `max_var_ratio_per_read = 0.05`, a 10,000 bp read is skipped if it has more than 500 candidate events.

Example:

```text
read length = 10000
candidate events = 700
threshold = 10000 * 0.05 = 500
700 > 500, so the read is skipped
```

The second skip rule is based on the fraction of the read covered by read-level noisy regions:

```text
noisy_region_length_on_read > mapped_length * max_noisy_frac_per_read
```

With the default `max_noisy_frac_per_read = 0.5`, a 10,000 bp read is skipped if more than 5,000 bp are covered by noisy regions.

Skipped reads remain in the chunk's read list, but downstream collection and noisy-region support counting ignore them. This preserves debug visibility while preventing poor alignments from dominating candidate discovery.

This distinction creates two levels of filtering:

```text
alignment-level filtering:
  read is not loaded at all if it is unmapped, secondary, supplementary, low MAPQ, etc.

read-level skipping after Digar construction:
  read was loaded and parsed, but is ignored for candidate/noisy support because it is too variant-dense or too noisy
```

The second level requires Digar construction first, because the program cannot know whether a read has too many events or too much noisy coverage until the alignment has been converted into Digar operations.

##### 8. Read-Level Noisy-Region Detection

Noisy-region detection begins **while** Digars are being built for each read. The implementation walks the alignment once; whenever a non–low-quality SNP, insertion, or deletion is recorded, it feeds a **sliding-window accumulator** that sums event “weight” inside a fixed genomic width on the reference. If that sum exceeds a threshold, the read is considered locally unreliable and a **read-level noisy interval** is opened, extended, or merged—**before** chunk-level union in §9; that list is refined after allele counting in §12.

This design mirrors longcallD’s intent: dense mismatch and indel signal in a short window is a proxy for local misalignment or excessive micro-errors, so simple pileup-style calling there is untrustworthy.

###### Parity with longcallD (`xid_queue_t` / `push_xid_size_queue_win`)

In longcallD, the same algorithm lives in `bam_utils.c` as `xid_queue_t` and `push_xid_size_queue_win`. In pgPhase, the equivalent logic is **`XidQueue`** and **`xid_push_win`** in `bam_digar.cpp`, wrapped by **`NoisyRegionBuilder`** (constructor picks window width from technology, `observe_variant` pushes events, `flush` emits a trailing open interval).

**The sliding-window math is the same:** push `(pos, len, count)`, subtract evicted events from the front while `pos[front] + len[front] - 1 <= pos - win`, and when `count > 0` and the running sum **`> max_s`** (`noisy_reg_max_xgaps`), compute `noisy_start = pos[front]`, `noisy_end = pos[rear] + lens[rear]`, then merge or flush intervals using the same adjacency rule and the same **`var_size = max(sum of counts, genomic span)`** label.

**Intentional structural differences** (output-equivalent for interval geometry):

| Aspect | longcallD | pgPhase |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Where intervals go** | Immediately `cr_add` into a per-read `cgranges_t` (0-based half-open storage). | Append **`Interval{start,end,label}`** to `ReadRecord::noisy_regions` (**1-based inclusive**). Chunk code later converts via `intervals_to_cr` / merge when it needs trees. |
| **`is_dense[]` flag** | Allocated and set to 1 for queue indices when noisy; **never read** elsewhere in that file. | **Omitted** (dead state in longcallD). |
| **Eviction loop** | `while` without `front <= rear` guard. | **`while (front <= rear && …)`** so the loop never indexes past an empty queue (defensive port). |

So the **detection rule and merge behaviour match longcallD**; pgPhase differs in **C++ data layout** (vectors on `ReadRecord`, defer building `cgranges` until chunk merge) and in **dropping unused bookkeeping**.

The effective window is:

```text
--noisy-slide-win if provided
25 bp in ONT mode
25 bp in short-read mode
100 bp in HiFi mode
```

The maximum allowed event load in the window is `noisy_reg_max_xgaps`, default `5`. Event contributions are:

```text
SNP: 1
Insertion: inserted length
Deletion: deleted length
```

Example:

```text
HiFi window = 100 bp
noisy_reg_max_xgaps = 5

Events on a read:
  chr11:1000 SNP, contribution 1
  chr11:1010 INS length 2, contribution 2
  chr11:1030 DEL length 3, contribution 3

Total contribution in 100 bp = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
6 > 5, so a read-level noisy interval is started.
```

The noisy interval spans from the earliest event currently in the window to the latest event. Adjacent or overlapping noisy intervals on the same read are merged.

The interval also carries a numeric label. When a dense event window is flushed, the label is the larger of:

```text
sum of event contributions in the window
span length of the interval
```

This label is passed through the interval data structure and is used by the merge routines as interval metadata. Conceptually, it records how large or severe the noisy interval is.

Long terminal clips also create noisy regions. A soft or hard clip longer than `30 bp` at a read end creates a noisy interval extending `100 bp` into the reference from the clip edge, matching longcallD's strict `len > LONGCALLD_NOISY_END_CLIP` check.

Example:

```text
CIGAR: 40S160M
alignment starts at chr11:5000

40S is a long left-end clip.
Add noisy interval approximately chr11:5000-5100.
```

This captures places where the read alignment begins or ends abruptly, which may indicate local misalignment, structural variation, or unresolved sequence.

Only terminal clips are used for this long-clip noisy-region rule. Internal clips are not treated the same way here. A left-end clip creates a region starting at the current reference position and extending to the right; a right-end clip creates a region extending leftward into the reference. The C++ `Interval` coordinates are chosen so that the later `intervals_to_cr` conversion lands on the same 0-based `cr_add(..., pos-1, ...)` starts used by longcallD for clipped ends.

##### 9. Chunk Finalization

After reads have been loaded and sorted for a chunk, the chunk is finalized:

```text
compute base-quality histogram
load reference slice with flanking sequence
detect low-complexity reference intervals
collect and merge read-level noisy intervals into chunk-level noisy intervals
```

The reference slice spans active reads plus a `50000 bp` flank on each side, clipped to the contig boundary. If all reads are skipped, the slice falls back to the chunk interval itself.

Low-complexity sequence is detected with `sdust` over the reference slice. These intervals are later used to extend noisy regions and to classify repeat-associated indels.

The current `sdust` parameters are:

```text
threshold = 5
window = 20
```

The low-complexity intervals are stored in genomic coordinates relative to the chunk reference slice. They are not candidate variants by themselves; they are context annotations used by later noisy-region and repeat-indel logic.

Example:

```text
chunk: chr11:100000-200000
active reads span chr11:95000-210000
reference flank = 50000

reference slice:
  chr11:45000-260000
```

The chunk-level noisy-region list is initially formed by concatenating noisy intervals from non-skipped reads and merging overlapping or adjacent intervals.

##### 10. Candidate Site Collection

After chunk finalization (§9), the collector builds a raw candidate site list from non-skipped reads. This matches longcallD `collect_all_cand_var_sites` (including fuzzy large-insertion collapse within the chunk).

For each read and each Digar:

```text
ignore skipped reads
ignore non-variant Digars such as Equal, clips, and RefSkip
ignore low-quality variant Digars
ignore variant Digars outside the chunk boundaries
convert SNP/INS/DEL Digar to VariantKey
append CandidateVariant with empty counts
```

Low-quality variant Digars are not allowed to create new candidate sites. However, if another high-quality read already created the candidate site, a low-quality matching observation can still be counted later as `low_qual_cov` during allele counting. This avoids discovering sites from weak evidence while still preserving information about low-quality observations at discovered sites.

Example raw events:

```text
read1: chr11:1000 SNP A>G
read2: chr11:1000 SNP A>G
read3: chr11:1005 DEL length 2
read4: chr11:1010 INS T
```

The raw candidate table initially contains all four observations. It is then sorted and collapsed into unique candidate sites:

```text
chr11:1000 SNP A>G
chr11:1005 DEL length 2
chr11:1010 INS T
```

The duplicated SNP appears once as a site. Allele counts are computed in §11.

Large insertions use fuzzy collapsing. Insertions of at least `30 bp` at the same position are considered equivalent if their lengths are similar:

```text
min(length1, length2) >= 0.8 * max(length1, length2)
```

Example:

```text
read1: chr11:2000 INS length 52
read2: chr11:2000 INS length 55

52 >= 0.8 * 55 = 44
These are collapsed into one candidate site.
```

Small insertions require exact sequence equality:

```text
chr11:2000 INS A
chr11:2000 INS T

These remain separate candidate sites.
```

**Deletions (no fuzzy length merge):** longcallD `exact_comp_var_site_ins` applies the 0.8 length rule **only to large insertions**. Deletions are the same site only when they share the same breakpoint and **`ref_len`** (deletion length on the reference). Two deletions at the same position with **different** lengths (e.g. 40 bp vs 50 bp) remain **separate** candidate rows—there is no longcallD-style fuzzy merge for large DELs, and pgPhase matches that.

###### 10.1 Worked Case: Same-Position Multi-Length Deletions (`chr11:1255550`)

At `chr11:1255550`, two phased deletion rows may be emitted with different lengths (for example
`SVLEN=-118` and `SVLEN=-236`). This follows directly from the deletion keying and downstream gates:

1. Candidate construction keeps deletions with different `ref_len` as separate rows (no deletion fuzzy merge).
2. Allele counting accumulates support independently per deletion length.
3. Noisy-region classification and Step 4 noisy MSA recall remove weak/unstable alternatives and retain
   supported alleles.
4. Phasing (`§18`, Step 3.2 + Step 4 re-run when applicable) assigns hap-consensus state per surviving row.
5. Projected phased VCF emission (`§22.1`) writes one biallelic record per surviving deletion allele with
   its own `GT:PS`.

Therefore, multiple raw deletion representations at the same anchor can collapse to exactly two emitted
phased deletion records when those two are the only alleles that survive support, noisy-region, and
projection gates.

The sort order is deterministic and longcallD-compatible. It compares:

```text
contig id
sort position
variant type
reference length
alternate length
alternate sequence for SNPs and small insertions
```

For SNPs, the sort position is the SNP position. For insertions and deletions, the sort position is `pos - 1`, matching the insertion-between-bases convention.

##### 11. Allele Count Collection

Once unique candidate sites are known (§10), the pipeline performs a second pass over non-skipped reads to count support for each site (`collect_cand_vars` in longcallD; `collect_allele_counts_from_records` here). **Next**, chunk-level noisy intervals are refined (§12), and only then does variant classification (§13) run.

For each read, the algorithm starts near the first candidate overlapping the read. It then walks the sorted candidate table and the read's variant Digars together.

For each candidate:

```text
if the read has a matching Digar:
    count an alternate observation
else if the read spans the candidate position:
    count a reference observation
else:
    no observation
```

The matching test uses a longcallD-compatible merge-site comparison equivalent to `update_cand_vars_from_digar`: the depth sweep skips only `Equal` digars, so clips/refskips and other non-equal digars still participate in ordering while candidate rows remain SNP/INS/DEL keys. Therefore, a read carrying a large insertion can support a candidate large insertion even if the inserted sequence is not exactly identical, as long as the large-insertion fuzzy comparison considers them equivalent. This is important for long reads, where large inserted alleles may be represented with slightly different lengths or sequences across alignments.

Reference observations are counted only when the read reaches the candidate position. A read that ends before the site, starts after the site, maps to another contig, or is skipped contributes no observation for that candidate.

Alternate observations are marked low-quality if:

```text
the Digar was already low-quality
or the average base quality supporting the Digar is less than min_bq
```

Low-quality alternate observations increment `low_qual_cov` and do not increment `total_cov` or `alt_cov`. This means the classifier can use `total_cov` for high-quality allele fraction while still using `total_cov + low_qual_cov` when checking whether the site had enough overall read evidence.

Example:

```text
Candidate: chr11:1000 SNP A>G

10 high-quality reads support ref
1 high-quality read supports alt
3 low-quality reads support alt

total_cov = 11
ref_cov = 10
alt_cov = 1
low_qual_cov = 3
depth_with_low_quality = 14
```

This candidate still fails `min_alt_depth = 2`, because only high-quality alternate observations contribute to `alt_cov`.

For deletions, the average quality used in this second pass is computed over the same anchor bases that represent the deleted interval in the read. For insertions and SNPs, it is computed over the read bases carrying the alternate sequence.

Counts tracked per candidate are:

```text
total_cov
ref_cov
alt_cov
low_qual_cov
forward_ref
reverse_ref
forward_alt
reverse_alt
allele_fraction
```

Example:

```text
Candidate: chr11:1000 SNP A>G

read1 spans 1000 and has G: alt, forward
read2 spans 1000 and has A: ref, reverse
read3 spans 1000 and has G: alt, reverse
read4 does not cover 1000: ignored

total_cov = 3
ref_cov = 1
alt_cov = 2
forward_alt = 1
reverse_alt = 1
allele_fraction = 2 / 3 = 0.667
```

If `--read-support` is enabled, the same pass writes per-read observations. This output supports downstream phasing by recording whether each read supports the reference or alternate allele at each candidate site.

##### 12. Pre-Processing Noisy Regions

After candidate sites and allele depths are in place (§10–§11), chunk-level noisy regions are refined (`pre_process_noisy_regs`). The provisional list is the read-union from §9; this step extends through low-complexity sequence, merges nearby intervals, and drops intervals with insufficient read support. Classification (§13) uses the refined mask, matching longcallD `collect_var_main`.

The preprocessing order is:

```text
raw read-supported noisy intervals
extend through overlapping low-complexity intervals
merge nearby noisy intervals
count read support for each merged interval
discard noisy intervals with insufficient support
```

###### 12.1 Extension Through Low-Complexity Regions

If a noisy interval overlaps a low-complexity interval, it is extended to include that low-complexity sequence.

Example:

```text
noisy interval:        chr11:1000-1030
low-complexity repeat: chr11:1020-1100

extended noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
```

This is relevant because indel alignment around homopolymers and short tandem repeats is often unstable. A small noisy signal near the edge of a repeat may represent the entire repeat region rather than only the original interval.

###### 12.2 Merge Nearby Noisy Regions

After extension, nearby noisy intervals are merged using `noisy_reg_merge_dis`, default `500 bp`, and `min_sv_len`, default `30 bp`.

Example:

```text
noisy A: chr11:1000-1100
noisy B: chr11:1300-1400
distance = 199 bp

Because 199 <= 500, merge:
  chr11:1000-1400
```

This prevents a complex locus from being split into many small intervals.

###### 12.3 Read-Support Filter for Noisy Regions

The code then counts support for each merged noisy interval.

For each non-skipped read:

```text
if the read overlaps any part of the noisy interval:
    increment n_total
    if the read has a read-level noisy interval overlapping it:
        increment n_noisy
```

The noisy region is kept only if the following hold:

```text
n_noisy >= min_alt_depth
n_noisy / n_total >= min_af
```

If `min_noisy_reg_total_depth` is greater than zero, the implementation also requires:

```text
n_total >= min_noisy_reg_total_depth
```

The default is `0`, which does **not** add an extra check (this matches the longcallD `pre_process_noisy_regs` logic, which only uses the two conditions above with `n_noisy` and the ratio of `n_noisy` to `n_total`). The published LongcallD methods description also lists a **minimum total overlapping read count**; set `--min-noisy-reg-total-depth 5` to enforce that third gate. When `0`, there is no separate “total read coverage” minimum.

With defaults (when `min_noisy_reg_total_depth` is 0 or unset in code):

```text
min_alt_depth = 2
min_af = 0.20
```

Example dropped region:

```text
merged noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
20 reads overlap any part of it
1 read has noisy evidence there

n_noisy = 1 < 2
The interval is removed from chunk.noisy_regions.
```

Example kept region:

```text
merged noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
20 reads overlap any part of it
6 reads have noisy evidence there

n_noisy = 6
n_noisy / n_total = 6 / 20 = 0.30
0.30 >= 0.20
The interval remains a trusted noisy region.
```

This step prevents one poor read from causing an entire locus to be treated as noisy.

Because this support check occurs after low-complexity extension and noisy-region merging, the denominator and numerator are measured on the merged interval, not on each original read-level interval. The implementation therefore tests whether the final candidate noisy locus is supported by sufficient reads.

###### 12.4 Coordinate Convention Used by Later Noisy MSA (Step 4)

`chunk.noisy_regions` is stored in C++ as `Interval{beg,end}` while longcallD Step 4 noisy calling starts from the `cr_start(...)` value held in its `cgranges` interval. For finalized chunk noisy regions, pgPhase preserves that longcallD start value through the dedicated `intervals_from_cr_lcd_chunk_noisy_post_merge` / `intervals_to_cr_lcd_chunk_noisy_post_merge` conversions. Consequently `collect_noisy_vars1` uses `noisy_reg_beg = reg.beg` and `noisy_reg_end = reg.end` on entry. This avoids the 1 bp insertion-anchor drift that appears if the generic `Interval` 1-based conversion is applied a second time after longcallD-style post-processing.

##### 13. Initial Variant Classification

Each candidate is classified using coverage, allele fraction, and local sequence context. A Fisher
strand-imbalance test is applied only in ONT mode, matching longcallD (§13.2).

The first computed value is:

```text
depth_with_low_quality = total_cov + low_qual_cov
allele_fraction = alt_cov / total_cov if total_cov > 0 else 0
```

The classification order is important.

###### 13.1 Low Coverage

A candidate is `LOW_COV` if:

```text
depth_with_low_quality < min_depth
or alt_cov < min_alt_depth
```

Example:

```text
min_depth = 5
min_alt_depth = 2

candidate depth = 4
alt_cov = 3

depth 4 < 5, so category = LOW_COV
```

Another example:

```text
depth = 20
alt_cov = 1

alt_cov 1 < 2, so category = LOW_COV
```

###### 13.2 Strand Bias (ONT only)

This matches longcallD `classify_var_cate`: the Fisher / strand-bias check runs
**only** when the read-technology mode is ONT (`opt->is_ont` in longcallD).

In ONT mode, the code applies a Fisher exact test to alternate forward and
reverse support. It compares observed alternate strand counts to an expected
balanced split. If the two-tailed p-value is below `strand_bias_pval`, the
candidate is `STRAND_BIAS`.

Example:

```text
forward_alt = 10
reverse_alt = 0
```

This is suspicious because all alternate observations are on one strand; with
sufficient support the two-tailed p-value can fall below the threshold, giving
`STRAND_BIAS`.

In **HiFi** and **short-read** modes, there is no separate strand-bias
category from this test: the implementation follows longcallD and does not run
Fisher (or a substitute heuristic) for non-ONT.

###### 13.3 Low Allele Fraction

If allele fraction is below `min_af`, the initial category is `LOW_AF`.

Example:

```text
alt_cov = 3
total_cov = 30
AF = 0.10
min_af = 0.20

category = LOW_AF
```

Later, this is converted to `LOW_COV` in the longcallD-compatible classification pass.

###### 13.4 Clean Homozygous Candidate

If allele fraction is above `max_af`, the category is `CLEAN_HOM`.

Example:

```text
alt_cov = 19
total_cov = 20
AF = 0.95
max_af = 0.80

category = CLEAN_HOM
```

This indicates that nearly all reads support the alternate allele.

###### 13.5 Repeat-Associated Heterozygous Indel

For insertions and deletions, the classifier checks whether the indel is in a homopolymer or short tandem repeat context. This only applies to short indels controlled by `noisy_reg_max_xgaps`, default `5`.

The homopolymer/repeat decision is made from the reference sequence around the candidate, not from the read names or read sequences alone. For short indels, the classifier checks two related patterns.

First, it tests for homopolymer or short-repeat context by scanning both sides of the indel for repeated units up to length `6`. The code checks whether at least three copies of the same unit are visible next to the variant.

Example homopolymer with unit length 1:

```text
Reference:  C A A A A A A A G
Unit:         A
Copies:       A A A ...
Candidate:     delete one A
```

Because the nearby reference consists of repeated `A` bases, the deletion is considered homopolymer-associated.

Example short tandem repeat with unit length 2:

```text
Reference:  G C A C A C A C A T
Unit:         C A
Copies:       CA CA CA ...
Candidate:       insert or delete CA
```

Second, the repeat-region check compares the reference sequence before and after the indel. For a deletion of length `L`, it compares approximately `3 * L` bases starting at the deletion with `3 * L` bases after the deletion. For an insertion of length `L`, it asks whether inserting the alternate sequence would preserve a local repeated pattern. These tests identify short tandem repeat contexts where equivalent alignments can be shifted left or right.

Example homopolymer:

```text
Reference: AAAAAAAA
Candidate: delete one A
```

Such a candidate is classified as:

```text
REP_HET_INDEL
```

The biological reason is that short indels in homopolymers and tandem repeats are frequently represented inconsistently by read alignments.

###### 13.6 Clean Heterozygous Candidate

If no previous filter applies, the candidate becomes:

```text
CLEAN_HET_SNP for SNPs
CLEAN_HET_INDEL for insertions and deletions
```

Example:

```text
candidate: chr11:1000 A>G
depth = 30
alt_cov = 15
AF = 0.50
forward_alt = 8
reverse_alt = 7
not in noisy region

category = CLEAN_HET_SNP
```

##### 14. Noisy-Region Feedback During Classification

Classification also feeds information back into the noisy-region model.

First, if a candidate overlaps a trusted chunk noisy region, it is classified as `NON_VAR`.

Example:

```text
trusted noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
candidate SNP: chr11:1050 A>G

category = NON_VAR
```

Under this condition, the candidate is not trusted as a clean pre-phasing site.

Second, repeat-associated indels are added back to a noisy-region interval set. If the repeat indel overlaps low-complexity sequence, the noisy interval is extended to include the low-complexity span.

Example:

```text
candidate: chr11:2000 deletion of A
reference context: AAAAAAAAAA

Add candidate span, extended through the homopolymer, to noisy regions.
```

Third, dense overlapping candidate sites are treated as noisy. The code builds an interval index of candidate positions. If a candidate overlaps more than one candidate position, the locus is considered dense.

Example:

```text
chr11:3000 SNP A>G
chr11:3000 INS T
chr11:3001 DEL length 1
```

These overlapping signals are unlikely to represent a simple isolated variant. The region is added to the noisy interval set when the local noisy-read ratio is sufficiently high.

The newly generated noisy intervals are merged with the previous chunk noisy intervals using `cr_merge2`.

The local noisy-read ratio check for dense loci is the same conceptual ratio used elsewhere:

```text
reads with read-level noisy evidence in the candidate span
---------------------------------------------------------
all non-skipped reads overlapping the candidate span
```

The dense locus is added to the noisy interval set only if this ratio is at least `min_af`. Repeat-associated indels are added without this extra ratio check, because the repeat classification itself is already sequence-context evidence that the locus is alignment-ambiguous.

##### 15. Post-Processing Noisy Regions

After classification, noisy intervals are expanded slightly and merged again.

Each noisy region starts with a default flank of `10 bp` on each side. The algorithm then **walks outward** from both ends through the sorted candidate list, extending the boundary as long as it finds eligible candidates adjacent to the current edge. The walk stops only when a gap of more than 1 bp separates the next candidate from the current boundary.

Categories skipped for this extension are:

```text
LOW_COV
STRAND_BIAS
NON_VAR
```

All other categories — `CLEAN_HET_SNP`, `CLEAN_HET_INDEL`, `CLEAN_HOM`, `REP_HET_INDEL`, `LOW_AF`, `NOISY_CAND_HET`, `NOISY_CAND_HOM`, `NOISY_RESOLVED` — are eligible to pull the boundary further.

**Chain expansion detail:** This is not a single-step "nearest neighbor" lookup. The boundary keeps moving as long as the next eligible candidate is within 1 bp of it, so a dense cluster of variants adjacent to a noisy region is absorbed entirely. Only a genuine sequence gap (> 1 bp between the current boundary and the next candidate) breaks the expansion. For each candidate that qualifies, the boundary is pulled to `variant_start - 10` (left walk) or `variant_end + 10` (right walk).

Example — single nearby candidate (does not touch):

```text
noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
initial extension: chr11:990-1110

right walk — next eligible candidate at chr11:1115-1117
  vs=1115 > cur_end+1=1111 → gap detected, walk stops
  cur_end stays 1110
```

Example — chain of adjacent candidates:

```text
noisy region: chr11:1000-1100
initial extension: chr11:990-1110

right walk:
  candidate at 1108-1110: vs=1108 ≤ 1111 → cur_end = 1110+10 = 1120
  candidate at 1118-1120: vs=1118 ≤ 1121 → cur_end = 1120+10 = 1130
  candidate at 1130-1135: vs=1130 ≤ 1131 → cur_end = 1135+10 = 1145
  next candidate at 1300:  vs=1300 > 1146 → gap, walk stops
  → final noisy region extends to 1145
```

After extension, overlapping intervals are merged.

Post-processing is performed after candidate classification because final noisy-region boundaries depend on nearby candidate categories. A clean nearby variant may extend a noisy locus, whereas `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, and `NON_VAR` sites do not extend it.

##### 16. Final Noisy-Containment Filter

After post-processing noisy regions, the pipeline performs a final containment sweep. Any candidate contained in a finalized noisy region is marked `NON_VAR`.

Example:

```text
final noisy region: chr11:5000-5100
candidate: chr11:5050 SNP C>T

category becomes NON_VAR
```

For insertions, containment is tested over the insertion's anchor interval:

```text
insertion at pos P is treated as interval [P-1, P)
```

This pass follows the ported longcallD containment behavior (`cr_is_contained`) and is applied by the current implementation regardless of read-technology mode.

##### 17. Reserved Noisy-Resolved Category

`VariantCategory::NoisyResolved` exists in the shared enum and output serializers, but the current `collect-bam-variation` implementation does not run a separate large-event promotion pass that rewrites `NOISY_CAND_HET`, `NOISY_CAND_HOM`, or `REP_HET_INDEL` to `NOISY_RESOLVED`.

In the present **digar collect** flow, `REP_HET_INDEL` remains `REP_HET_INDEL` unless later logic explicitly changes it. `NOISY_CAND_HET` / `NOISY_CAND_HOM` (`e` / `h`) are reserved for MSA-recalled variants inside noisy regions. The initial classifier most often produces `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, `LOW_AF`, `CLEAN_HOM`, `REP_HET_INDEL`, `CLEAN_HET_SNP`, `CLEAN_HET_INDEL`, and `NON_VAR`, with `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, and `NON_VAR` pruned before the retained candidate table is emitted.


##### 18. Intra-Chunk Phasing and Noisy-Region Recall (Steps 3.1, 3.2, 4)

Per-chunk biology is driven by **`collect_var_main`** (`collect_var.cpp`), which mirrors longcallD’s numbered `collect_var_main`: steps **1.x** (sites and allele counts), **2.x** (noisy prep, `classify_chunk_candidates`, noisy post-process, containment/pruning), then **3.1–3.2** (read profiles and k-means phasing). The worker entry point is **`process_chunk`** → **`collect_var_main`** (`collect_pipeline.cpp`).

Phasing runs **only when** `chunk.candidates` is non-empty after classification (same guard pattern as longcallD: no candidates ⇒ no profile or k-means work).

###### Step 3.1: `collect_read_var_profile` (static, `collect_var.cpp`)

For each non-skipped read, this walks digars and the sorted candidate table in lockstep. The matching behavior is now strict longcallD parity for this stage: overlap is checked by `ovlp_var_site(...)`, and allele identity uses `exact_comp_var_site(...)` (strict compare for all variant types, including insertions). It fills:

- **`ReadVariantProfile`** on `chunk.read_var_profile[read_i]`: sparse `alleles` / `alt_qi` for variant indices from `start_var_idx` through `end_var_idx`.
- Allele codes match longcallD profiling: **`0`** = ref, **`1`** = alt (if base quality passes `min_bq` and the digar is not marked low-quality), **`-2`** = low-quality alt observation (skipped in hap scoring), and trailing sites inside the read span with no alt digar match get **ref (`0`)** via the tail loop.

It also builds **`chunk.read_var_cr`**: a `cgranges` interval index with half-open **`[start_var_idx, end_var_idx + 1)`** per read, labeled by `read_i`. That index supports **`cr_overlap`** queries “reads covering variant *i*” used in the pivot sweep and in adjacent-het linkage counts—same geometry as longcallD `collect_read_var_profile`.

**Important distinction from candidate-site collapse (§10–§11):** fuzzy insertion equivalence (`exact_comp_var_site_ins`) is still used where longcallD uses it for candidate collection/merge, but this read-profile stage uses strict compare to avoid cross-allele absorption at multi-allelic same-position sites.

Reads are visited in **`ordered_read_ids`** order when that vector is populated (same as longcallD’s loop over `chunk->ordered_read_ids[i]`); otherwise indices **`0 … n_reads-1`** are used (equivalent after **`load_and_prepare_chunk`** sorts reads by start, end (desc), NM, qname).

###### Step 3.2: `assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans` (`collect_phase.cpp`)

Public entry declared in **`collect_phase.hpp`**. It implements longcallD **`assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans`**.

**Single call in phase 3 (`collect_var_main` when `n_cand_vars > 0`).** longcallD runs **`assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans`** once with
**`LONGCALLD_CLEAN_HET_SNP | LONGCALLD_CLEAN_HET_INDEL | LONGCALLD_CLEAN_HOM_VAR`**
(= **`LONGCALLD_CAND_GERMLINE_CLEAN_VAR_CATE`** / **`kCandGermlineClean`**). Comments in longcallD describe further rounds (`+ NOISY_CAND_*`, somatic); the k-means that includes **`LONGCALLD_CAND_GERMLINE_VAR_CATE`** is issued **later**, after noisy-region MSA (Step 4) when new variants exist — not in the same `if (n_cand_vars > 0)` block. pgPhase now mirrors that germline/noisy Step 4 path: MSA-recalled `NOISY_CAND_*` variants are merged into the chunk profile and trigger a second k-means pass with **`kCandGermlineVarCate`**. The separate longcallD `out_somatic` branch remains outside the current pgPhase model.

**Other masks.** **`kCandHetVarCate`** matches **`LONGCALLD_CAND_HET_VAR_CATE`**. **`kCandGermlineVarCate`** matches **`LONGCALLD_CAND_GERMLINE_VAR_CATE`** and is used after Step 4 noisy MSA recall when new noisy variants are merged.

**Category mask (general).** Callers pass `kCand*` flags; see **`collect_phase.hpp`**.

**Per-variant state (on `CandidateVariant`).**

- **`hap_to_alle_profile[1]` / `[2]`**: per-hap read counts per allele index. Width is **`variant_allele_slots`**: default **2** (ref/alt from `VariantCounts`). If **`VariantCounts::alle_covs`** is populated, width follows longcallD semantics (`n_uniq_alles` when >0, otherwise `alle_covs.size()`), preserving multi-allele slot layout parity.
- **`hap_to_cons_alle[0..2]`**: consensus allele indices; het sites start at `-1` for haps 1–2 until profiles accumulate.
- **`get_var_init_max_cov_allele`**: scans **`alle_covs`** with strict **`>`** (ties keep lower index), else **`ref_cov` / `alt_cov`**, matching longcallD’s `get_var_init_max_cov_allele` tie behavior.

**Algorithm phases (same structure as `assign_hap.c`).**

1. **Phase 1 — pivot sweep:** **`select_init_var`** picks the deepest `CLEAN_HET_SNP`, else `CLEAN_HET_INDEL`, else noisy het SNP/indel (homopolymer indels excluded from noisy-indel pivot). Variants are visited in an outward order from that pivot index within the **valid** (flag-filtered) list. For each variant, overlapping reads with **`haps[read_i] == 0`** get **`init_assign_read_hap`**, then **`update_var_hap_profile_cons_alle`**. Reads that still have no informative score are seeded as hap **1** (longcallD behavior). Hom categories are skipped in this round.
2. **Phase 2 — up to 10 iterations:** **`iter_update_var_hap_cons_phase_set`** counts spanning-read agreement vs conflict between **adjacent phased het** variants (via `read_var_cr` overlap on global variant indices). Weak linkage (`n_agree < 2` and `n_conflict < 2`) starts a new **phase_set** anchor at **`VariantKey::sort_pos()`** (SNP → `pos`, indel → `pos - 1`, matching longcallD). When conflicts dominate, **`flip`** toggles; the consensus swap uses longcallD’s loop **`for (hap = 1; hap <= LONGCALLD_DEF_PLOID; ++hap)`** swapping `[hap]` with `[3-hap]`—at diploid ploidy **2** this is **two swaps** and leaves **`hap_to_cons_alle[1]`/`[2]`** unchanged (binary parity with released `assign_hap.c`). **`iter_update_var_hap_to_cons_alle`** clears profiles, re-assigns every read in **`ordered_read_ids`** order, rebuilds profiles, and updates consensus; stops early if haps 1–2 consensus is unchanged.
3. **Phase 3:** **`update_read_phase_set`** sets each read’s **`phase_sets[read_i]`** from the first phased het variant in profile order.
4. **Phase 4:** Fill **`hap_alt` / `hap_ref`** on every candidate from finalized **`hap_to_cons_alle`**. These fields are reset before projection, matching longcallD `make_variants` local-variable behavior rather than accumulating stale values from an earlier pass. For ALT/REF polarization, non-zero consensus allele indices are treated as ALT (`c != 0`), matching longcallD output projection behavior for multi-allelic contexts.

**ONT:** Homopolymer indels use the **67%** read-support guard when updating consensus alleles, as in longcallD **`update_var_hap_to_cons_alle`**.

**Outputs.** Per-candidate **`phase_set`**, **`hap_alt`**, and **`hap_ref`** are written to the main TSV (§21). Per-read **`haps`** and **`phase_sets`** reside on **`BamChunk`** for downstream use; they are not serialized to the candidate TSV in the current implementation.

###### Step 4 (Post-3.2): Noisy-Region MSA Recall and Re-Phasing

After the clean-category k-means pass, pgPhase mirrors longcallD step 4 on finalized noisy regions:

1. Collect noisy-region reference slice and reads.
2. Build noisy-region alignments (PS-aware path when a phase set spans both haps, otherwise no-PS path).
3. Generate candidate variants from MSA/BALN strings.
4. Merge new noisy candidates into chunk candidates/profile.
5. Update noisy coverage/profile fields (`total_cov`, `ref_cov`, `alt_cov`, `LQC`) from full-cover reads.
6. Re-run read profiling and k-means with `kCandGermlineVarCate` when new variants were added.

Step 4 re-phasing can modify pre-existing within-chunk hap assignments and phase-set structure, not only phase newly recovered sites.

###### Step 4 Co-Iterative Outer Loop (`collect_noisy_vars_step4`)

The outer loop is not a single linear pass. It retries undone regions until no further progress is possible:

```
while true:
    for each undone noisy region:
        ret = collect_noisy_vars1(...)
        if ret >= 0: mark done; if ret > 0: any_new_var = true
        if ret < 0:  leave undone (MSA could not separate reads — retry later)
    if any_new_var:
        assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans(kCandGermlineVarCate)
        ← re-assigns ALL reads using clean + noisy candidates found so far
    if no region made progress this pass: break
```

A region returns `-1` when `collect_phase_set_with_both_haps` cannot find a phase set with sufficient reads on both haplotypes — the clean-site assignments did not reach this region with enough depth. Once another region succeeds and its new candidates trigger a k-means re-run, some previously-unphased reads may acquire hap assignments. The retry then finds enough phased reads to run the MSA. This handles dependency chains where adjacent noisy regions cannot bootstrap independently but together resolve each other.

###### How Reads Are Split Before abPOA (`collect_phase_set_with_both_haps`)

The clean-site k-means pass (Step 3.2) assigns each read a `hap` (1 or 2) and a `phase_set`. Step 4 uses those assignments directly — it does **not** re-run clustering from scratch inside the noisy region.

`collect_phase_set_with_both_haps` scans all reads in the noisy window and finds the phase set that has the best representation of **both** haplotypes among fully-spanning reads (`min_hap_full_reads` threshold) and among all reads including partial-cover (`min_hap_reads` threshold). It picks the phase set that maximises `min(n_full_hap1, n_full_hap2)` — the minority side.

If a qualifying phase set is found (`ps > 0`), the **PS-aware path** runs (`wfa_collect_noisy_aln_str_with_ps_hap`). If not, the **no-PS fallback** runs (`wfa_collect_noisy_aln_str_no_ps_hap`), which uses abPOA's internal k-means clustering to split reads without prior phase information.

###### abPOA Runs Separately Per Haplotype — Reference Is Not Inside abPOA

In the PS-aware path, reads are separated by haplotype **before** abPOA is called. abPOA is invoked twice, once per haplotype:

```
hap1 reads ──→ abpoa_partial_aln_msa_cons ──→ consensus₁ + per-read MSA rows
hap2 reads ──→ abpoa_partial_aln_msa_cons ──→ consensus₂ + per-read MSA rows
```

The reference sequence is **not** an input to abPOA. After both abPOA calls complete, the reference is aligned to each haplotype's consensus independently via a separate WFA pairwise alignment:

```cpp
// align.cpp — after abPOA, for each haplotype ci:
wfa_collect_aln_str(opts, ref_seq, ref_seq_len,
                    cons_seqs[ci].data(), cons_lens[ci], ...
                    aln_strs[ci][0]);  // [0] = ref-vs-cons alignment string
```

The result is a per-haplotype `aln_strs[ci][0]` (ref-vs-consensus) plus one per-read alignment string (read-vs-consensus row from abPOA MSA). These are the two coordinate systems needed to place each variant in reference coordinates and score each read's allele at that variant.

###### Variant Candidate Generation: Sorted Merge of Two Ref-Diff Lists

Each haplotype's consensus is independently diffed against the reference by `make_cand_vars_from_msa`, producing two position-sorted variant lists:

```
ref ↔ consensus₁  →  hap1_vars  (sorted by position + alt)
ref ↔ consensus₂  →  hap2_vars  (sorted by position + alt)
```

These two lists are then merged in a single sorted walk (`update_cand_var_profile_from_cons_aln_str2`) using `exact_comp_var_site` at each step. `exact_comp_var_site` requires identical position **and** identical alt sequence — 28-T and 29-T at the same position are **not** equal and remain separate candidates.

The three-way outcome of each comparison determines the variant's category and `var_from_cons_idx` bitmask:

| Comparison result | `var_from_cons_idx` | Category | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| hap1 has variant, hap2 does not (or different alt) | `1` | `NoisyCandHet` | variant in hap1 consensus only |
| hap2 has variant, hap1 does not (or different alt) | `2` | `NoisyCandHet` | variant in hap2 consensus only |
| both have identical variant at same position | `3` | `NoisyCandHom` | variant in both consensuses |

Any remaining entries in either list after the walk completes are appended as `NoisyCandHet` with the appropriate index (1 or 2).

###### Per-Read Allele Assignment (`update_cand_var_profile_from_cons_aln_str21`)

After the merged variant list is built, each read gets its allele at each variant site evaluated from its **own MSA row** — not inherited from the consensus. The consensus only establishes where the variant is; the read's actual sequence at that MSA column determines the allele.

For a hap1 read at a variant site with `var_from_cons_idx = 1`:

```cpp
if (var_from_cons_idx[i] & clu_idx) {       // this cluster's variant
    allele_i = get_var_allele_i_from_cons_aln_str(
                   cons_aln_str,             // read's own MSA row vs consensus
                   var, alt_pos, cons_sim_thres, &full_cover);
} else {                                     // other cluster's variant
    allele_i = 0;                            // forced REF by construction
}
```

`cons_sim_thres = 0.9`: the read must match the ALT sequence at ≥90% of the variant's MSA columns to receive `allele=1`. Below that threshold the read gets `allele=0`.

The per-read allele outcomes for a `NoisyCandHet` with `var_from_cons_idx=1`:
- **hap1 read, covers site, matches ALT** → `allele=1`
- **hap1 read, covers site, has REF** → `allele=0` (lost the consensus vote at this column)
- **hap1 read, does not span site** → `full_cover=0`, nothing recorded
- **hap2 read (any)** → `allele=0` forced by `var_from_cons_idx & clu_idx == 0`

This means a read that contributed to consensus₁ is not automatically assigned ALT — its own sequence content determines its allele. A minority of hap1 reads carrying REF at a site will get `allele=0` even though the consensus went ALT.

Implementation details aligned to longcallD:

- **Call order parity:** `collect_reg_ref_bseq` runs before `collect_noisy_reg_reads` so read extraction uses the clipped noisy boundaries.
- **Read-id parity in abPOA paths:** global read ids (not local vector indices) are passed through PS and no-PS MSA helper calls.
- **One-consensus handling parity:** single-consensus outputs treat the cluster/read-row mapping as in longcallD wrappers.
- **Boundary parity helpers:** partial-alignment trimming uses the ported longcallD `edlib_xgaps` + WFA boundary functions.
- **Homopolymer veto parity:** insertion homopolymer checks use the longcallD anchor behavior (`ref_pos-1`).
- **Allele-match threshold parity:** `is_match_aln_str` compares `n_eq >= len * cons_sim_thres` as floating-point arithmetic, matching longcallD and avoiding integer truncation at noisy insertion alleles.

###### 18.1 Mid-Free: Releasing Intermediates After K-means (`mid_free_chunk`)

After `collect_var_main` completes for a chunk, `process_chunk` calls **`mid_free_chunk`** to release heavy per-chunk fields before stitching holds all chunks of the contig in memory simultaneously.

This mirrors longcallD **`bam_chunk_mid_free`** (`bam_utils.c`), called from within each parallel worker before `stitch_var_main`. Both tools free the same subset of fields; correspondences are:

| pgPhase field | longcallD field | freed by |
|---|---|---|
| `r.digars` | `bam_read->digars` | `bam_chunk_free_digar` |
| `r.qual` | `bam_read->qual` | `bam_chunk_free_digar` |
| `r.noisy_regions` | `bam_read->noisy_regs` (cgranges) | `bam_chunk_free_digar` |
| `chunk.low_complexity_regions` | `low_comp_cr` | `cr_destroy` |
| `chunk.var_noisy_read_cov_cr` | `var_noisy_read_cov_cr` | `bam_chunk_clear_var_noisy_read_cache` |
| `chunk.var_noisy_read_err_cr` | `var_noisy_read_err_cr` | `bam_chunk_clear_var_noisy_read_cache` |
| `chunk.var_noisy_read_marks` | `var_noisy_read_marks` | `bam_chunk_clear_var_noisy_read_cache` |
| `chunk.var_noisy_read_mark_id` → 0 | `var_noisy_read_mark_id` → 0 | `bam_chunk_clear_var_noisy_read_cache` |
| `chunk.noisy_regions` | `chunk_noisy_regs` + `noisy_reg_to_reads/n_reads` | `cr_destroy` + free |
| `chunk.read_var_cr` | `read_var_cr` | `cr_destroy` |

Fields intentionally **not** freed (matching longcallD `bam_chunk_mid_free`):

| Kept field | Reason |
|---|---|
| `r.alignment` (BAM record) | Phased-BAM output and pgbam fallback stitching (`bam_aux_get("hs")`); longcallD keeps `bam_read->bam_record` |
| `chunk.ref_seq` | Freed later in post-free equivalent; longcallD defers to `bam_chunk_post_free` |
| `chunk.ordered_read_ids` | longcallD iterates it in `update_chunk_read_hap_phase_set1` |
| `chunk.read_var_profile` | longcallD never frees in mid or post_free (only in full `bam_chunk_free`) |

**Memory model.** All chunks for one contig stay in memory concurrently during stitching (§19). `mid_free_chunk` reduces per-chunk footprint before that window so peak RAM scales with **`n_chunks × (candidates + reads[haps/phase_sets/alignment])`** rather than the much larger **`n_chunks × (candidates + reads[all fields])`**.

##### 19. Chunk-Boundary Stitching (`stitch_chunk_haps`)

After all chunks in a contig batch are independently phased by k-means (§18), their haplotype assignments are **local**: hap 1 in one chunk may label the same physical haplotype as hap 2 in the next. `stitch_chunk_haps` (`collect_phase.cpp`) corrects this by inspecting reads that span chunk boundaries and flipping assignments where the majority disagree. Phase-set anchors are also merged so that consecutive, consistently oriented chunks form one continuous phase block.

This mirrors longcallD **`stitch_var_main`** / **`flip_variant_hap`** (`collect_var.c`) using the same
paired-index overlap read lists.

###### 19.1 Inner Function: `flip_chunk_hap(pre, cur)`

For each adjacent pair of chunks on the same contig, `flip_chunk_hap` runs these steps:

**Step 1 — validate paired overlap lists.**
For each BAM-partition index `bi`, `cur.up_ovlp_read_i[bi]` and `pre.down_ovlp_read_i[bi]` are treated as
paired lists by index `j`. The function first checks aggregate counts and throws on mismatch.

**Step 2 — early exit when either chunk has no candidates.**
If `pre.candidates` or `cur.candidates` is empty, no k-means ran and no flip is needed — stop.

**Step 3 — score paired boundary reads.**
Iterate `j` over each paired overlap list. For each valid pair `(pre_read_i, cur_read_i)`, if both reads are
non-skipped and both have `hap != 0`, update:

```text
if pre_hap == cur_hap:  flip_score -= 1   (consistent — counts against a flip)
if pre_hap != cur_hap:  flip_score += 1   (inconsistent — counts toward a flip)
track max_pre_ps = max over matched reads of pre.phase_sets[pre_read_i]
track min_cur_ps = min over matched reads of cur.phase_sets[cur_read_i]
```

If `flip_score == 0` (tied or no informative boundary reads), the longcallD common-read path has no decisive signal. `flip_chunk_hap` returns `false`; when `--pgbam-file` is active, `stitch_chunk_haps` then tries the `.pgbam` adjacent-chunk fallback (§19.7). Without a sidecar, the boundary is left unchanged. Other early exits also return `false` before scoring, including no boundary-overlap reads, different contigs, or either chunk having no candidates.

**Step 4 — apply flip/no-flip orientation and phase-set merge.**
If `flip_score < 0`, the common-read path still stitches the boundary with `do_flip = false` and merges the current anchor into the previous anchor. If `flip_score > 0`, it stitches with `do_flip = true`. Only `flip_score == 0` skips `apply_chunk_flip_and_merge`.

For every `CandidateVariant v` in `cur`:
- If `do_flip` and `v.phase_set == min_cur_ps`: swap `hap_to_cons_alle[1] ↔ [2]`.
- If `v.phase_set == min_cur_ps` and both anchors are valid: rewrite `v.phase_set = max_pre_ps`.

`apply_chunk_flip_and_merge` (extracted helper) applies both parts: if `do_flip`, it swaps `hap_to_cons_alle[1] ↔ [2]`; when phased alignment output is requested it also flips read `haps` (`3 - hap`) for reads whose `phase_sets` entry equals `min_cur_ps`. If both anchors are valid, it rewrites candidate `phase_set` from `min_cur_ps` to `max_pre_ps` and, when phased alignment output is requested, rewrites matching read `phase_sets` too. Projected phased VCF output derives GT orientation directly from `hap_to_cons_alle`.

**`stitch_chunk_haps`** iterates pairs `(chunks[0], chunks[1])`, `(chunks[1], chunks[2])`, … left to right, calling `flip_chunk_hap` for each.

###### 19.2 Phase-Set Anchor Semantics

`min_cur_ps` is the earliest phase-set anchor among boundary-spanning reads in the current chunk; `max_pre_ps` is the latest anchor among the matching reads in the previous chunk. After common-read stitching, all variants that carried `min_cur_ps` carry `max_pre_ps`, effectively **extending the previous chunk’s phase block** into the current one and merging them into a single continuous block. Reads are rewritten by the common-read path only when phased alignment output is requested; `.pgbam` merges always rewrite the matching read hap/phase-set state because later sidecar comparisons depend on live read phase blocks.

###### 19.3 Worked Example — No Flip Needed

```text
Chunks: C0 (chr11:1–500000)  →  C1 (chr11:500001–1000000)

Boundary reads (span 490000–510000):
  readA: C0 hap=1 ps=450000  →  C1 hap=1 ps=500000
  readB: C0 hap=2 ps=450000  →  C1 hap=2 ps=500000

flip_score = -1 - 1 = -2   (both consistent)
do_flip = false
max_pre_ps = 450000,  min_cur_ps = 500000

C1 variants with ps=500000: phase_set rewritten to 450000.
C1 reads with ps=500000: phase_set rewritten when phased alignment output is active.
C1 candidates: hap_to_cons_alle unchanged.
Result: C0 and C1 share one phase block anchored at 450000.
```

###### 19.4 Worked Example — Flip Needed

```text
Chunks: C0 (chr11:1–500000)  →  C1 (chr11:500001–1000000)

Boundary reads (span 490000–510000):
  readA: C0 hap=1 ps=450000  →  C1 hap=2 ps=500000   (inconsistent)
  readB: C0 hap=2 ps=450000  →  C1 hap=1 ps=500000   (inconsistent)
  readC: C0 hap=1 ps=450000  →  C1 hap=2 ps=500000   (inconsistent)

flip_score = +1 +1 +1 = +3
do_flip = true
max_pre_ps = 450000,  min_cur_ps = 500000

C1 variants with ps=500000:
  hap_to_cons_alle[1] ↔ [2] swapped
  phase_set: 500000 → 450000
C1 reads with ps=500000:
  hap: 1↔2 and phase_set rewritten when phased alignment output is active

Result: C1 labels are coherent with C0; both in one phase block anchored at 450000.
```

###### 19.5 Minority-Outlier HP-Tag Conflicts

The majority-vote flip decision is decisive by definition, but a minority of boundary reads will have voted against it. These reads end up with inconsistent HP tags across chunks.

###### What "inconsistent HP tag" means

Consider a three-read boundary where two reads are inconsistent (pre_hap ≠ cur_hap) and one is consistent (pre_hap == cur_hap):

```text
flip_score = +1 + 1 - 1 = +1   →   do_flip = true

Reads and their vote:
  readA: pre_hap=1, cur_hap=2  →  voted FOR flip  (inconsistent, +1)
  readB: pre_hap=1, cur_hap=2  →  voted FOR flip  (inconsistent, +1)
  readC: pre_hap=1, cur_hap=1  →  voted AGAINST flip (consistent, -1)
```

After `apply_chunk_flip_and_merge` applies `do_flip = true`:
- readA: hap in cur chunk becomes 1 (was 2, flipped) → matches pre_hap=1. Consistent.
- readB: hap in cur chunk becomes 1 (was 2, flipped) → matches pre_hap=1. Consistent.
- readC: hap in cur chunk becomes 2 (was 1, flipped) → conflicts with pre_hap=1. **Inconsistent.**

readC is the minority-outlier read: it agreed with the pre-chunk orientation, but the flip was applied globally to all cur-chunk reads, so its cur-chunk HP tag was involuntarily changed.

###### What HP tag the read gets in the output BAM

The HP tag in the output BAM is written from the **owning chunk's** `haps[]` array. A read is owned by the chunk in which it was first phased — whichever chunk's k-means assigned it. The owning chunk's `haps[]` is the source for BAM output; the overlap list only transfers phase to reads not yet assigned (those with `hap == 0`).

`propagate_overlap_read_phase_to_output_owner` (called in `stitch_chunk_haps`) only fills in reads where `pre.haps[read] == 0` — it does **not** resolve conflicts where the pre-chunk already assigned a non-zero hap:

```cpp
// collect_phase.cpp — propagate_overlap_read_phase_to_output_owner
if (pre.haps[static_cast<size_t>(pre_read_i)] != 0) continue;  // skip already-phased
pre.haps[pre_read_i] = cur.haps[cur_read_i];  // only fills in unphased
```

So:
- Reads owned by `cur` get the post-flip cur-chunk HP tag (the flipped value).
- Reads owned by `pre` keep the pre-chunk HP tag unchanged.
- A minority-outlier read owned by `pre` keeps its pre-chunk tag, even though its cur-chunk hap was flipped away from that value.
- A minority-outlier read owned by `cur` gets the post-flip cur-chunk tag, even though its pre-chunk tag pointed the other way.

###### Expected behavior

This is the expected behavior, matching longcallD's majority-vote stitching model. longcallD's `flip_variant_hap` applies the same global flip to the entire chunk based on the majority of boundary reads, with no per-read arbitration for outliers. The minority-outlier reads' HP tags reflect their owning chunk's orientation after the flip — they are not retroactively corrected.

The fraction of such reads is bounded by the vote margin: if `flip_score = N_inconsistent - N_consistent`, then `N_consistent < N_inconsistent`, so fewer than half of the boundary reads are minority outliers. In practice, when phasing signal is strong, this fraction is very small.

###### 19.6 Pairing Semantics and Error Guards

The implementation uses longcallD-style j-th index pairing between `pre.down_ovlp_read_i` and
`cur.up_ovlp_read_i`. It includes explicit runtime guards:

- throw if aggregate overlap counts differ between adjacent chunks,
- throw if a per-list index pairing mismatch is detected,
- throw if a paired read index is out of bounds.

These guards make stitching failures explicit instead of silently continuing with inconsistent
boundary read pairing.

###### 19.7 Pipeline Architecture and Threading Model

###### Per-contig batch loop

The outer loop in `run_collect_bam_variation` groups chunks by `reg_chunk_i` — a monotonically increasing counter that resets at each contig boundary. All chunks with the same `reg_chunk_i` value belong to the same contig and form one batch:

```text
while batch_begin < chunks.size():
    batch_end = first index where reg_chunk_i changes   ← one contig
    batch = collect_chunk_batch_parallel(batch_begin, batch_end)   ← PARALLEL
    stitch_chunk_haps(batch.chunks, &opts, sidecar.get())          ← SEQUENTIAL
    merge_chunk_candidates(batch.chunks)                            ← exact-site merge, active-region preference
    write output (TSV / VCF / phased VCF / read-support / phase-read / phased alignment)
    batch_begin = batch_end
```

Each contig is fully processed and written before the next contig begins. The tool never holds more than one contig's worth of `BamChunk` objects in memory simultaneously.

###### Parallel phase (per-chunk, embarrassingly parallel)

`collect_chunk_batch_parallel` dispatches a `std::thread` pool over all chunks in the batch. Each worker independently runs BAM ingestion, variant classification, and k-means haplotype assignment for its assigned chunks. No shared state is accessed during this phase. Because haplotype assignment is local, each chunk independently picks an arbitrary orientation for its hap-1 and hap-2 labels — they are meaningless relative to adjacent chunks until stitching resolves them.

###### Sequential stitch (single thread, left to right)

After all workers join, `stitch_chunk_haps` runs on the main thread. Without `--pgbam-file`, it performs only the longcallD common-read adjacent-chunk sweep. With `--pgbam-file`, it first runs a `.pgbam` within-chunk phase-block merge and then runs the adjacent-chunk sweep with `.pgbam` fallback enabled:

```text
pass 1 — within-chunk:
    for each chunk in left-to-right order:
        stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam(chunk, sidecar)  ← only when --pgbam-file is set

pass 2 — cross-chunk:
    for each adjacent pair (chunk[i-1], chunk[i]):
        flip_chunk_hap(chunk[i-1], chunk[i], opts)      ← longcallD common-read path
        if common-read path returns false and pgbam is active:
            stitch_adjacent_chunks_with_pgbam(chunk[i-1], chunk[i], sidecar)

pass 3 — optional final contig cleanup:
    if --no-pgbam-cleanup-pass is not set:
        stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam(chunks, sidecar,
                                       --pgbam-cleanup-min-winning,
                                       --pgbam-cleanup-margin)

pass 4 — optional relaxed final contig cleanup:
    if --no-pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-pass is not set:
        stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam(chunks, sidecar,
                                       --pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-min-winning,
                                       --pgbam-relaxed-cleanup-margin)
```

Within-chunk stitching runs first so that by the time the cross-chunk pass reaches a boundary, each chunk already has its internal phase blocks oriented consistently. The cross-chunk pass then draws thread signal from the full merged read population of the boundary-adjacent phase block rather than from a single small block.

For the pgbam path, "full merged read population" is represented by live hap-thread state, not by carrying forward old pairwise vote totals. When phase blocks A and B merge, the implementation unions B's oriented hap-thread sets into A's cached state. The next comparison, AB versus C, recomputes a fresh 2x2 concordance matrix from AB's current hap-thread evidence and C's hap-thread evidence. The previous A-versus-B score is deliberately discarded because it answered a different question and would bias the next boundary. This sidecar-specific logic lives in `collect_phase_pgbam.cpp`; `collect_phase.cpp` only decides when to invoke it.

###### Why stitching must be sequential

Each stitching step can rename `phase_sets` values, which changes the inputs to the next step. Step `i+1`'s left anchor (`max_pre_ps` for cross-chunk, or `left_ps` from `psets[i]` for within-chunk) depends on whether step `i` succeeded and updated those values. Parallelising the stitch would require synchronisation over the shared `haps[]` and `phase_sets[]` arrays with no meaningful speedup, since the total read count across all chunks of one contig is the bottleneck and the stitching scan is linear in that count.

This matches longcallD's `stitch_var_main`, which is also a sequential left-to-right sweep after the parallel chunk-processing workers join.

###### Memory: why `mid_free_chunk` is required before stitching

Stitching holds every `BamChunk` of the contig in memory simultaneously. `mid_free_chunk` (called inside each parallel worker, §18.1) releases the heavy per-chunk intermediates — read variant profiles, noisy region interval trees, candidate depth tallies — beforehand, keeping only what stitching and output require: `reads[].alignment` (needed by `bam_aux_get("hs")` in the pgbam path and by phased-BAM output), `haps[]`, `phase_sets[]`, and `candidates[]`.

###### 19.8 pgbam Phase-Block Stitching

When a pgbam sidecar is loaded, `stitch_chunk_haps` invokes the sidecar module in two places. First, it runs `stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam` inside each chunk to merge local phase blocks that share graph-thread evidence. Second, if `flip_chunk_hap(pre, cur, opts)` returns `false`, it calls `stitch_adjacent_chunks_with_pgbam` as a **pangenome-graph thread intersection** fallback.

###### Why common-read stitching can fail

The common-read path requires at least one read that is phased in both the previous chunk and the current chunk. Such reads exist when coverage is continuous across the chunk boundary and reads are long enough to span it. This assumption breaks in several realistic scenarios:

- **Structural variants at the boundary.** A deletion, inversion, or large insertion can displace reads so that no read aligns across the breakpoint.
- **Assembly or reference gaps.** Hard-masked or absent reference sequence creates coverage voids that reads cannot span.
- **Extreme coverage drops.** Even without a structural event, low-coverage regions can leave a boundary with zero spanning reads by chance.

In zero-overlap or uninformative-overlap cases, the chunks are not known to be in phase; the common-read evidence channel is absent or inconclusive. The sidecar path supplies a different evidence channel rather than leaving orientation unresolved when graph-thread support is decisive.

###### Why pangenome-graph threads provide orientation evidence

A pgbam-annotated BAM (produced by a pangenome aligner such as GraphAligner or vg) annotates each read with the **graph set IDs** of the pangenome paths it aligns to (stored in the `hs` BAM tag). The pgbam sidecar maps those set IDs to **graph thread IDs** — the individual haplotype sequences in the pangenome reference graph.

The key insight is that thread membership is a haplotype-level property of the graph, not a read-overlap property: reads on the same physical haplotype tend to align to the same graph threads even when they come from genomic positions too far apart to share alignment. A read from haplotype 1 in chunk A and a read from haplotype 1 in chunk B will share thread IDs if the underlying physical haplotype is continuous — regardless of whether those two reads overlap at the sequence level.

This provides **orientation evidence across gaps** that the common-read path cannot see.

###### Design rationale and benefits

| Property | Design decision | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Common-read precedence | adjacent-chunk pgbam stitching runs only when `flip_chunk_hap` returns false | Non-zero common-read evidence always takes precedence across chunk boundaries; pgbam cannot override an existing boundary vote |
| Unweighted intersection | Support = raw thread-ID intersection count, not coverage-weighted | Thread IDs are already haplotype-resolved; weighting by coverage would conflate depth with haplotype identity |
| 2x2 hap concordance | Adjacent blocks are compared as hap1/hap2 thread-set intersections (`s11`, `s12`, `s21`, `s22`) | The signal is block-local orientation evidence, not accumulated historical vote totals |
| Polarized thread support | Each graph thread keeps hap1/hap2 read-support counts; a thread contributes to one hap only when the count difference reaches the configured polarity margin | Repeated read support can rescue useful hap-specific signal without treating every thread seen on both haps as ambiguous |
| Live merged state | A successful within-chunk merge carries forward oriented hap-thread sets, not old pairwise scores | Large merged blocks contribute their accumulated hap identity without letting previous merge decisions inflate later scores |
| Read-thread cache | Within-chunk stitching resolves each read's `hs` tag once before the sweep | Many small short-read phase blocks do not repeatedly parse the same BAM aux tags |
| Cached polarized sets | `hap_polarized_threads[1/2]` are stored in `PhaseBlockThreadState` and refreshed only on state creation/merge | Comparisons against a large merged block do not repeatedly re-polarize every thread |
| Temporary stitch memory | Cached read-thread and phase-block states live only inside `stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam` | RAM increases during the within-chunk pgbam sweep, but the cache is released before moving to the next chunk |
| Configurable winner support | Orientation call requires the winning side to reach the configured minimum shared polarized threads | The default primary pass screens out single-thread noise; cleanup passes can be enabled or disabled and tuned from the CLI |
| Graceful degradation | Tied score or too few winner intersections → return false, boundary left unstitched | No worse than baseline; incorrect orientation is actively avoided |
| Read-skip on unresolved `hs` | Reads with no `hs` tag or unmapped set IDs are skipped, not counted | Partial sidecar coverage is tolerated; only positively resolved reads contribute signal |

###### Algorithm

**Adjacent-chunk entry condition.** The adjacent-chunk pgbam fallback is reached whenever `flip_chunk_hap(pre, cur, opts)` returns `false`. That includes: different contigs, no boundary-spanning reads, either chunk having no candidates, all overlap reads being skipped or unphased, or phased overlap reads voting to an exact tie (`flip_score == 0`). In all these cases the common-read path did not apply a boundary stitch.

**Anchor computation (fallback).** Because boundary-spanning reads are absent or uninformative, `max_pre_ps` and `min_cur_ps` are recomputed from all phased reads in each chunk rather than from the overlap lists: `max_pre_ps` = largest `phase_sets` value among non-skipped, hap-assigned reads in `pre`; `min_cur_ps` = smallest such value in `cur`. If either chunk has no phased reads, the fallback returns false.

**Within-chunk anchors.** `stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam` first collects all non-negative `phase_sets` from hap-assigned, non-skipped reads, sorts them by anchor position, deduplicates them, and sweeps the resulting anchor list left to right. The anchor list is fixed, but entries are rewritten after successful merges (`psets[i] = left_ps`) so the next iteration uses the surviving merged identity.

**Read-thread cache.** Within a chunk, `build_read_thread_cache` resolves each read's `hs` tag once:

```text
read_i -> sorted unique graph thread IDs
```

This cache is then reused to initialize the phase-block states. It avoids the previous behavior where each adjacent-block comparison repeatedly scanned the whole chunk and reparsed the same `hs` aux tags.

The read-thread cache is temporary. It is allocated inside the within-chunk stitch call for one chunk, used to seed the starting `PhaseBlockThreadState` objects, and then released when the function returns. It is not stored on `BamChunk` and does not persist into output emission.

**Thread collection.** For each phased read in the relevant phase block, the pgbam module resolves graph-thread IDs from the read:

1. `extract_hs_set_ids` parses the BAM `hs` auxiliary array tag (type `B`, subtypes `I`/`i` 4-byte, `S`/`s` 2-byte, `C`/`c` 1-byte) and returns a `uint32_t` vector of set IDs.
2. Each set ID is looked up in `PgbamSidecarData::set_to_threads`. All resolved thread IDs are appended to a `std::vector<uint64_t>` for that group.
3. Reads with no `hs` tag, an empty tag, or set IDs absent from the sidecar are skipped. If no reads contribute, the resulting thread vector stays empty and the later concordance scorer naturally lacks support for that hap/block side.
4. Per-read thread IDs are sorted and deduplicated. Phase-block state keeps read-level occurrences so repeated support can polarize a thread toward one haplotype.

**Phase block state.** Each block carries a compact live state:

```cpp
struct PhaseBlockThreadState {
    hts_pos_t anchor;
    std::array<std::vector<uint64_t>, 3> hap_read_threads;
    std::vector<ThreadSupport> thread_support;
    std::array<std::vector<uint64_t>, 3> hap_polarized_threads;
};
```

Only indexes 1 and 2 are used. For a starting phase block, `hap_read_threads[1]` and `hap_read_threads[2]` accumulate the per-read graph threads from reads assigned to that hap and phase-set anchor. `thread_support` stores one row per graph thread with `hap1_count` and `hap2_count`. `hap_polarized_threads[1]` and `[2]` cache the threads whose support difference reaches the active polarity margin.

The two families of vectors have different roles:

```text
thread_support          = full counted evidence carried forward for future merges
hap_polarized_threads   = comparison-ready evidence used directly by the 2x2 scorer
```

Keeping both costs extra temporary memory, but avoids repeatedly re-counting and re-polarizing threads from a growing merged block. This is useful for short-read data, where many small initial phase blocks can merge into a large left block and then be compared to many subsequent neighbors.

**Reference thread sets.** The two blocks being compared are called A and B below. Whenever a block state is built or merged, `refresh_phase_block_polarized_threads` computes the comparison-ready evidence using the active polarity margin:

```text
A1_polarized = threads where A.hap1_count - A.hap2_count >= margin
A2_polarized = threads where A.hap2_count - A.hap1_count >= margin
B1_polarized = threads where B.hap1_count - B.hap2_count >= margin
B2_polarized = threads where B.hap2_count - B.hap1_count >= margin
```

**2x2 hap concordance.** Orientation is scored by intersecting the adjacent blocks' polarized thread sets:

```text
s11 = |A1_polarized ∩ B1_polarized|
s12 = |A1_polarized ∩ B2_polarized|
s21 = |A2_polarized ∩ B1_polarized|
s22 = |A2_polarized ∩ B2_polarized|

score_nonflip = s11 + s22
score_flip    = s12 + s21
```

Within a chunk, `stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam` caches each read's resolved thread IDs once, builds one `PhaseBlockThreadState` per starting phase-set anchor, and then sweeps anchors left to right. On a successful merge, the right block's `ThreadSupport` counts are first oriented according to the flip decision and then added into the left block's counts. The next comparison therefore uses all counted thread evidence from the merged phase block, while old pairwise scores are discarded.

**Merge-state update.** The cached state update mirrors the real read/candidate update performed by the pgbam-sidecar merge helper:

```text
if do_flip:
    swap B.hap1_count and B.hap2_count for every thread
else:
    keep B.hap1_count and B.hap2_count

AB.thread_support = per-thread sum of A counts and oriented B counts
AB.hap_polarized_threads = re-polarize AB.thread_support with the active margin
AB.anchor = A.anchor
```

This means a large merged block carries all of its hap-thread support into the next comparison. It does **not** carry the old `score_nonflip` / `score_flip` values. Those old scores describe whether A should merge with B; they are not evidence for whether AB should merge with C.

**Orientation decision:**

```text
if score_nonflip == score_flip          → leave unstitched (tied)
if max(score_nonflip, score_flip) < min_winning_threads
                                      → leave unstitched (insufficient signal)
if score_flip > score_nonflip           → do_flip = true
else                                    → do_flip = false
```

The winner threshold is configurable per pgbam stage. The default primary path uses `min_winning_threads = 2`; the final cleanup stages default to `1`.

**Apply.** The pgbam path applies the fallback-derived `do_flip`, `max_pre_ps`, and `min_cur_ps` through `apply_pgbam_phase_merge`, which flips and/or renames both candidate phase state and read hap/phase-set state.

**Within-chunk application.** For within-chunk stitching, `apply_pgbam_phase_merge(chunk, do_flip, left_ps, right_ps)` flips and/or renames only reads and candidates currently carrying the right block's anchor. After that mutation, the cached state at the current sweep position is replaced with the merged AB state and `psets[i]` is rewritten to `left_ps`. If a later block C merges, `left_ps` is already the surviving anchor and the cached left state already contains A and B.

**Cross-chunk application.** For cross-chunk fallback, the same `decide_phase_block_concordance` scorer is used, but the state is collected on demand for the boundary-adjacent phase blocks: `max_pre_ps` in the previous chunk and `min_cur_ps` in the current chunk. Cross-chunk stitching still mutates only the current chunk, rewriting `min_cur_ps` to `max_pre_ps` and optionally flipping its haps.

**Complexity and memory.** Within a chunk, `hs` parsing is `O(reads)` once. Initial block construction appends each cached read-thread set to one block/hap bucket and sorts/counts each bucket into `ThreadSupport`. Polarized vectors are computed only when a block state is created or after a successful merge. Each stitch comparison then intersects four already-prepared sorted polarized vectors by linear merge. Successful merges sum two sorted `ThreadSupport` vectors and refresh the two polarized vectors. This avoids the previous repeated full-chunk read scans and repeated polarization for every adjacent phase-block boundary, which is important when short reads create many small phase blocks.

The RAM cost is an intentional temporary cache: during one within-chunk pgbam sweep, the implementation holds per-read resolved thread vectors, per-block counted thread support, and per-block polarized vectors. The cache is scoped to one chunk's within-chunk stitch pass and is released before the next chunk is processed, so it does not change the long-lived `BamChunk` memory model.

**Data model.** `PgbamSidecarData` (declared in `collect_types.hpp`) holds the sidecar map:

```cpp
struct PgbamSidecarData {
    std::unordered_map<uint32_t, std::vector<uint64_t>> set_to_threads;
};
```

`Options::pgbam_file` (added to `Options` in `collect_types.hpp`) stores the path; an empty string means the fallback is disabled. The sidecar is loaded once in `run_collect_bam_variation` via `load_pgbam_sidecar` and passed as a `const PgbamSidecarData*` to every `stitch_chunk_haps` call.

###### 19.8 pgbam Sidecar Format

The sidecar is a little-endian binary file loaded by `load_pgbam_sidecar` (`collect_pipeline.cpp`). Its layout:

```text
Offset  Size  Description
------  ----  -----------
0       4     Magic: ASCII "PGS1"
4       4     Version: uint32_le — must be 1
8       1     R-index flag: uint8 (read, not used by pgphase)
9       4+N   Fingerprint: uint32_le length N, then N bytes (read, not validated)
13+N    …     Records, repeating until EOF:
              set_id:    uint32_le
              n_threads: uint32_le
              thread_ids[n_threads]: uint64_le each
```

Duplicate `set_id` values within one file are rejected with `std::runtime_error`. All reads are done with `std::istream` and each field checked for EOF, so a truncated file produces a diagnostic error rather than undefined behaviour.

##### 20. Merging Candidate Tables Across Chunks

Each chunk produces a candidate table with **`collapse_fuzzy_large_insertions` already applied inside that chunk** (same as longcallD `collect_all_cand_var_sites`). For each **`reg_chunk_i` batch** (see §4), the pipeline walks chunk tables in order and performs only an **exact-key** merge for duplicate `VariantKey` rows. There is **no** second `collapse_fuzzy_large_insertions` on the concatenated list, matching longcallD (candidate-site deduplication is per BAM/region chunk only; chunk-boundary stitching (§19) does not fuzzy-merge candidate sites).

When exact duplicate keys collide across chunks, the row whose `lcd_make_variants_region_pass` flag is true is preferred. This mirrors the active-region selection effect of longcallD `make_variants`: a duplicate from a neighboring chunk should not replace the candidate that belongs to the current active region. If both rows have the same pass state, the earlier row remains the winner and the pass flag is OR-ed.

Example:

```text
chunk 1: chr11:1-500000
chunk 2: chr11:500001-1000000

If two fuzzy-equivalent large insertion rows appeared in different chunks (unusual but possible
near boundaries), they remain separate rows unless their complete `VariantKey` values are identical.
Exact duplicates collapse to one row, with active-region-passing rows preferred.
```

##### 21. TSV Output

The primary output is a TSV file. Each row is a candidate variant with counts and category:

```text
CHROM
POS
TYPE
REF
ALT
DP
REF_COUNT
ALT_COUNT
LOW_QUAL_COUNT
FORWARD_REF
REVERSE_REF
FORWARD_ALT
REVERSE_ALT
AF
CATEGORY
INIT_CAT
PHASE_SET
HAP_ALT
HAP_REF
```

- **`CATEGORY`**: final label after the full longcallD-shaped classify pass, post-process, containment filter, and not-candidate pruning. Use this for phasing filters and for VCF projection eligibility (`--vcf-output` / `--phased-vcf-output`) plus `INFO.CAT`.
- **`INIT_CAT`**: first-pass `classify_var_cate` only (matches longcallD’s first `CandVarCate-` block before `After classify var:`). Use for parity checks against `longcallD -V 2` stderr (`scripts/compare_candidates.py --category-stage initial`).

Example row:

```text
chr11  1000  SNP  A  G  30  15  15  0  8  7  9  6  0.5  CLEAN_HET_SNP  CLEAN_HET_SNP  1000  1  2
```

- **`PHASE_SET`**: `CandidateVariant::phase_set` from k-means — the `sort_pos()` of the first variant in the block (`pos` for SNPs, `pos - 1` for indels); **0** if phasing did not assign a set. The value is genomic position only, with no chromosome embedded. The canonical phase block identifier is the `(CHROM, PS)` pair; downstream tools (WhatsHap, GATK) interpret it this way, so the same numeric value on two different chromosomes is not a collision.
- **`HAP_ALT` / `HAP_REF`**: polarized haplotype ids (**1** / **2** for het scaffolding, **3** for hom alt-on-both, **0** when unset), from `assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans` Phase 4.

The row is still a **candidate** table, not a full diploid VCF genotype: these columns are the **read-clustering scaffold** from §18 with boundary stitching from §19, not full MSA or global assembly phasing. **`collect_output.hpp`** / **`collect_output.cpp`** document I/O contracts (Doxygen): VCF `FILTER` and `INFO.CAT` follow **final** `CATEGORY`; writers may **throw** `std::runtime_error` if the primary BAM header cannot be read or an output path cannot be opened.

For deletions, the reference allele is fetched from the FASTA. For insertions, the TSV uses `REF = "."` and stores the inserted sequence in `ALT`.

Before TSV emission, the pipeline prunes longcallD not-candidate categories: `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, and `NON_VAR`. The TSV writer then emits every row remaining in the final candidate table. The **`CATEGORY`** column is still essential for downstream phasing because retained rows can include non-clean categories such as `LOW_AF`, `REP_HET_INDEL`, `NOISY_CAND_HET`, or `NOISY_CAND_HOM`; `NOISY_RESOLVED` is reserved but not currently assigned by the collect path.

Typical phase-informative categories are:

```text
CLEAN_HET_SNP
CLEAN_HET_INDEL
```

Potentially useful but not heterozygous-marker categories include:

```text
CLEAN_HOM
REP_HET_INDEL
```

Categories such as `REP_HET_INDEL`, `LOW_AF`, `NOISY_CAND_HET`, `NOISY_CAND_HOM`, and the currently reserved `NOISY_RESOLVED` require category-aware handling and are generally excluded from ordinary clean germline phasing markers unless a downstream model explicitly wants them.

##### 22. Optional VCF Output

If `--vcf-output` is provided, the command writes a **final-call projected VCF** (longcallD-style output
surface), not a dump of every candidate TSV row.

SNP representation:

```text
candidate: chr11:1000 A>G
VCF:
  POS = 1000
  REF = A
  ALT = G
```

Insertion representation uses the previous reference base as an anchor:

```text
insertion between 999 and 1000, inserted TGA
anchor base at 999 = C

VCF:
  POS = 999
  REF = C
  ALT = CTGA
```

Deletion representation also uses the previous reference base as an anchor:

```text
delete bases 1000-1002, anchor base at 999 = C, deleted sequence = ATG

VCF:
  POS = 999
  REF = CATG
  ALT = C
```

Only projected germline/noisy-call categories are emitted to VCF: `CLEAN_HET_SNP`, `CLEAN_HET_INDEL`, `CLEAN_HOM`, `NOISY_CAND_HET`, and `NOISY_CAND_HOM`. Retained candidate-only rows such as `LOW_AF` or `REP_HET_INDEL` stay visible in TSV but are omitted from VCF. `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, and `NON_VAR` are pruned before TSV/VCF emission.

There is no extra left-normalization/rotation layer beyond the longcallD-equivalent representation logic above; this is intentional for parity with longcallD writer behavior.

For emitted rows, FILTER follows longcallD-style call output:

```text
PASS    emitted variant rows
RefCall reserved for non-variant calls (typically omitted by projection)
LowQual reserved for low-quality filtered calls (typically omitted by projection)
NoCall  reserved for depth=0 calls (typically omitted by projection)
```

`--vcf-output` remains site-level (no FORMAT/sample columns), but emitted sites now follow final-call
projection gates for longcallD parity:

```text
category in {CLEAN_HET_SNP, CLEAN_HET_INDEL, CLEAN_HOM, NOISY_CAND_HET, NOISY_CAND_HOM}
total_cov >= min_depth
alt_cov >= min_alt_depth
ALT-bearing genotype after hap-consensus projection
lcd_make_variants_region_pass == true
valid INS/DEL alt_ref_base anchor
no ambiguous REF/ALT bases unless --amb-base is set
```

The VCF depth gate follows longcallD `write_var_to_vcf`: `DP` is `CandidateVariant::counts.total_cov`, and the row is skipped when `total_cov < min_depth` or `alt_cov < min_alt_depth`. `low_qual_cov` remains visible in `INFO.LQC` and participates in `LOW_COV` classification through `total_cov + low_qual_cov`, but it is **not** added to `DP` for VCF emission.

For noisy-region indels, `alt_ref_base` follows longcallD `make_variants`: when it is not `4`, that raw consensus anchor is used for the first ALT byte. Values outside A/C/G/T are rejected before writing, matching longcallD's `write_var_to_vcf` invalid-alt-base behavior.

The `INFO` field includes:

```text
END
CLEAN for clean categories
SVTYPE and SVLEN for large indels (|SVLEN| >= min_sv_len, default 30)
DP
REFC
ALTC
LQC
AF
CAT
```

**SVLEN sign convention (VCF spec):** `SVLEN` is the difference in length between ALT and REF (`ALT_len - REF_len`). For deletions REF is longer, so `SVLEN` is negative (e.g. a 82 bp deletion has `SVLEN=-82`). For insertions ALT is longer, so `SVLEN` is positive. This is the standard VCF 4.2 convention; tools like bcftools and VEP expect this sign.

##### 22.1 Optional Phased VCF Output (`--phased-vcf-output`)

If `--phased-vcf-output FILE` is given, the pipeline writes a projected phased VCF (same projected site set as
`--vcf-output`) with `GT:PS` FORMAT fields derived from the k-means scaffold (§18). This is the output visible
in files like `pgphase_phased.vcf`.

**GT** (Genotype) encodes the diploid allele assignment at each site:

```text
1|0   hap1 = ALT, hap2 = REF  (phased, hap_alt=1, hap_ref=2)
0|1   hap1 = REF, hap2 = ALT  (phased, hap_alt=2, hap_ref=1)
1|1   homozygous ALT on both   (hap_alt=3)
0/0   homozygous REF           (generic writer branch; projected output filters these rows)
./.   unresolved by k-means    (generic writer branch; projected output filters these rows)
```

The pipe `|` separator signals a phased genotype; the slash `/` separator signals an unphased one. This follows the VCF 4.2 specification. In projected output, rows are filtered to ALT-bearing calls before writing, so the `0/0` and `./.` branches are retained as generic writer safety paths rather than expected emitted records.

**PS** (Phase Set) is the anchor coordinate of the phase block. It is set to the `PHASE_SET` value from the k-means output — the `sort_pos()` of the first variant in the block (see §21). It is written as `.` for unphased calls (`0/0` and `./.`). Two records sharing the same `(CHROM, PS)` value were phased together in one k-means run; a change in PS on the same chromosome marks a phase-set break caused by insufficient spanning reads between adjacent het variants.

Example phased VCF record:

```text
chr11  1000  .  A  G  .  PASS  END=1000;CLEAN;DP=30;...  GT:PS  1|0:1000
```

The `GT:PS` fields come from the same `hap_alt`/`hap_ref`/`phase_set` fields that populate the TSV
`HAP_ALT`/`HAP_REF`/`PHASE_SET` columns. `--vcf-output` does **not** include FORMAT/sample columns; only
`--phased-vcf-output` does.

For parity-critical multi-allelic sites, phased GT orientation inherits the strict longcallD-polarized
`hap_alt`/`hap_ref` mapping (`c != 0` treated as ALT) described in §18 Step 3.2.

##### 23. Optional Read-Support Output

If `--read-support` is provided, the command writes one row per read-candidate observation:

```text
CHROM
POS
TYPE
REF_LEN
ALT
QNAME
IS_ALT
LOW_QUAL
REVERSE
MAPQ
CHUNK_BEG
CHUNK_END
```

Example:

```text
chr11  1000  SNP  1  G  read_42  1  0  1  60  1  500000
```

This indicates that `read_42` supports the alternate allele `G` at `chr11:1000`; the observation is not low-quality, the read is on the reverse strand, and the observation originated from chunk `1-500000`.

For phasing, this file is valuable because it converts the candidate set into read-by-site allele observations.

The read-support output is collected during the allele-counting pass, before final classification pruning. Consequently, it can include observations for sites that are later classified as `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, or `NON_VAR` and therefore do not appear in the final TSV. A downstream consumer should treat this file as an observation log and join against the final TSV when it needs the retained candidate set.

###### 23.1 Optional Phase-Read TSV Output (`--phase-read-tsv`)

If `--phase-read-tsv FILE` is provided, the command writes one row per loaded read after per-contig stitching:

```text
CHUNK_ID
REG_CHUNK_I
CHROM
CHUNK_BEG
CHUNK_END
QNAME
READ_CHROM
INPUT_IDX
READ_BEG
READ_END
MAPQ
REVERSE
SKIPPED
HAP
PHASE_SET
```

This is a debugging view of `chunk.haps` and `chunk.phase_sets`, not the final candidate table. A subtle implementation detail matters: the common-read stitch path rewrites read-level hap/phase-set arrays only when phased alignment output (`-S`, `-b`, or `-C`) is requested, mirroring longcallD's output-alignment update path. Candidate phase state is still stitched for VCF/TSV projection. `.pgbam` merges always rewrite matching read state because later sidecar stitching relies on live read phase blocks. Therefore, without phased alignment output or `.pgbam` read merges, `--phase-read-tsv` can show per-read boundary state that lags the merged candidate phase-set state at common-read-stitched boundaries.

##### 23.2 Optional Phased Alignment Output (SAM/BAM/CRAM)

If `-S`, `-b`, or `-C` is provided, `collect-bam-variation` emits a phased alignment stream with
`HP`/`PS` tags, following longcallD `write_read_to_bam` behavior. This output can be emitted in:

```text
-S / --out-sam   FILE   text SAM
-b / --out-bam   FILE   BAM
-C / --out-cram  FILE   CRAM (requires reference)
```

`--refine-aln` enables longcallD-style alignment refinement before writing phased reads.

###### 23.2.1 CLI and mode semantics

Implementation surface:

- `collect_pipeline.cpp` parses `-S/-b/-C` into `Options::output_aln` + `Options::output_aln_format`.
- `--refine-aln` sets `Options::refine_aln`.
- `Options::command_line` stores the full CLI string for `@PG CL`.

Mode selection is **flag-driven**, not filename-extension-driven:

```text
-S -> hts mode "w"
-b -> hts mode "wb"
-C -> hts mode "wc"
```

This matches longcallD's output-open behavior (`hts_open` mode selected by CLI option).

###### 23.2.2 Writer construction and header behavior

The writer lives in `collect_bam_output.cpp` (`PhasedAlignmentWriter`).

On construction:

1. Open output alignment handle (`hts_open` with mode above).
2. For CRAM output, bind reference (`hts_set_fai_filename`) for encoding.
3. Set output threads (`hts_set_threads`).
4. Duplicate input header and add `@PG` line:
   - `ID=pgphase`
   - `VN=0.0.0`
   - `CL=<captured command line>`
5. Write output header (`sam_hdr_write`).
6. Open all input BAM/CRAM files again for write-back iteration and load their headers/indexes.

Failure handling is longcallD-style fatal behavior in this path (error message + immediate terminate),
not deferred exception recovery.

###### 23.2.3 Read iteration and overlap-skipping model

For each processed chunk, the writer re-iterates input BAM records over that chunk interval:

```text
iter = sam_itr_queryi(idx, tid, reg_beg-1, reg_end)
```

Per input BAM partition `bi`, longcallD-style overlap bookkeeping is used:

- `chunk.up_ovlp_read_i[bi]` controls how many already-emitted **processed** reads to skip.
- `chunk.n_up_ovlp_skip_reads[bi]` controls how many already-emitted **unprocessed** reads to skip.

This prevents duplicate output for reads that span adjacent chunks while preserving full per-chunk
stream behavior.

Filtering inside the write loop mirrors longcallD:

```text
unprocessed if:
  BAM_FUNMAP | BAM_FSECONDARY | BAM_FSUPPLEMENTARY
  or MAPQ < min_mapq
```

Unprocessed records are still written (after overlap-skip), but `HP`/`PS` are stripped.

###### 23.2.4 HP/PS tagging rules

For processed records:

- `HP`:
  - set/update when `hap != 0`
  - remove when `hap == 0`
- `PS`:
  - set/update when `phase_set > 0`
  - remove when `phase_set <= 0`

Tag type and append semantics match longcallD (`'i'`, 4-byte payload).
If tag exists and value is unchanged, it is left untouched; if value differs, old tag is removed and
new value appended.

###### 23.2.5 `--refine-aln` behavior

When `--refine-aln` is enabled, processed reads run through `refine_bam1` before tag write:

1. Set `core.pos` from first digar position (`1-based -> BAM 0-based`).
2. Rebuild CIGAR from read digars using longcallD merge behavior (`longcalld_push_cigar` equivalent):
   - adjacent same op merged by length accumulation,
   - hard clips in primary (non-supplementary) CIGAR converted to soft clips.
3. If old/new CIGAR differ:
   - rebuild BAM data layout (QNAME + new CIGAR + rest of payload),
   - update `core.n_cigar`, `l_data`.
4. Recompute auxiliary tags (if present):
   - `NM` from SNP/INS/DEL edit counts,
   - `MD` from ref-aligned mismatch/deletion trace,
   - `cs` from digar operations and reference bases.

Important parity detail:

```text
NM/MD/cs are updated only when those tags already exist on the record,
matching longcallD update_bam1_tags behavior.
```

So this path does not synthesize missing `MD`/`cs`; it updates existing tags when refined alignment
changes them.

###### 23.2.6 Post-MSA digar rewrite (critical for refine parity)

A strict parity-critical step occurs before final BAM refinement in noisy regions:

- `align.cpp` now performs longcallD-style post-MSA digar rewrite
  (`update_digars_from_aln_str` / `update_digars_from_msa1` equivalents),
  using:
  - left/right digar chopping helpers,
  - full/left/right MSA digar reconstruction,
  - longcallD merge semantics for rebuilt digars.

This rewrite is gated exactly to refine-alignment output mode:

```text
n_cons > 0 && opts.refine_aln && !opts.output_aln.empty()
```

Without this rewrite, refine output can still be close, but CIGAR/NM parity diverges at noisy loci.
With it enabled, refined BAM parity aligns with longcallD for the tested fixtures.

###### 23.2.7 Worked behavior example

Example command:

```text
pgphase collect-bam-variation -t1 --hifi --refine-aln \
  -b phased_refined.bam ref.fa sample.bam chr11:1255000-1260000 -o out.tsv
```

For each processed read in chunk:

```text
chunk haps/phase_sets -> update HP/PS
chunk digars          -> refine CIGAR/POS
existing NM/MD/cs     -> rewrite to refined values
write BAM record
```

For each filtered/unprocessed read:

```text
strip HP/PS
write original alignment payload unchanged
```

###### 23.2.8 Validation and parity status

On the repository parity dataset (`test_data/HG002_chr11_hifi_test.bam`,
`chr11:1255000-1260000`), after the strict parity ports in this path:

```text
normal phased BAM  : pgphase == longcallD (0 diff lines)
refined phased BAM : pgphase == longcallD (0 diff lines)
```

The zero-diff check is done on sorted SAM views of emitted BAMs, ensuring record-order neutrality.

###### 23.2.9 Output alignment indexing (`.bai` / `.crai`)

After phased alignment writing completes, pgPhase now auto-indexes binary alignment outputs:

```text
if output format == BAM  -> build .bai
if output format == CRAM -> build .crai
if output format == SAM  -> no index
```

Implementation details:

- `collect_pipeline.cpp` closes the phased writer first (`phased_aln_writer.reset()`), ensuring all
  records are flushed to disk before indexing.
- Index creation uses HTSlib `sam_index_build(output_path, 0)`.
- Failure to index is treated as a hard runtime error (`failed to index output alignment: <path>`).

This mirrors practical longcallD workflows where output BAM/CRAM is expected to be immediately
queryable in IGV/samtools without a manual follow-up `samtools index` step.

##### 24. Determinism and Reproducibility

Several implementation choices are designed to make output deterministic:

```text
reads are sorted by start, then end (desc), NM, and query name
candidate sites are sorted by a stable longcallD-compatible comparator
within a batch, each worker writes results into a fixed per-chunk slot (chunk index order)
streaming append order follows the global RegionChunk vector order, batch by batch
```

For the same input files and options, changing `--threads` does not change the final TSV candidate set or row order. The validation script checks this property by comparing single-threaded and multi-threaded HiFi output (hashed file identity).

For phased VCF parity validation against longcallD, use:

```text
bash scripts/compare_phased_vcf.sh chr11 --hifi
bash scripts/compare_phased_vcf.sh chr11 --ont
```

The script passes the selected mode flag through to `pgphase` and keys same-position multi-allelic records by ALT for non-SVLEN records, avoiding false diffs from key collapse.

For phased BAM parity validation, two helper scripts are available:

```text
bash scripts/verify_refine_bam_parity.sh
  Runs pgPhase + longcallD in normal and --refine-aln modes,
  diffs sorted SAM output, and reports pass/fail.

bash scripts/verify_refine_regression.sh
  Runs pgPhase only (no longcallD dependency),
  compares sorted SAM SHA-256 hashes against pinned known-good values
  for normal and --refine-aln fixtures.
```

`verify_refine_regression.sh` also prints offending unified-diff lines when a hash mismatch is
detected (first 200 lines for normal/refine), and preserves temp artifacts for inspection on fail.

##### 25. Non-Goals and Current Boundaries

This command intentionally stops at longcallD-parity candidate collection/classification, Step 4 noisy-region MSA recall with k-means integration, projected VCF emission, and chunk-boundary stitching (§19). It does **not** perform:

```text
somatic noisy-region calling from longcallD's `out_somatic` path
final genotype likelihood (GL) models or production diploid genotyping
supplementary-alignment stitching
split-read structural-variant reconstruction
```

These boundaries matter for interpretation. `NON_VAR`, `LOW_COV`, and `STRAND_BIAS` are internal classifications that cause a site to be pruned from the final candidate TSV; they are not final biological assertions that no event exists at the locus. **`PHASE_SET` / `HAP_*`** summarize the in-pipeline phasing state from §18 (including noisy-region MSA integration) plus boundary stitching from §19; they are not genotype-likelihood inference or somatic calling.

##### 26. Summary of the Complete Pipeline

This section provides an end-to-end step-by-step walkthrough of the exact execution order,
from CLI entry to final outputs.

###### 26.1 Entry, Option Parsing, and Technology Mode

**Code path:** `main.cpp` -> `collect_pipeline.cpp::collect_bam_variation` -> `collect_pipeline.cpp::run_collect_bam_variation` -> `collect_types.hpp::Options`.

1. `main.cpp` dispatches `collect-bam-variation` to `collect_bam_variation(...)` in `collect_pipeline.cpp`.
2. `collect_bam_variation(...)` parses CLI options into `Options` (`collect_types.hpp`), including thresholds, output paths, and threading, then dispatches to `run_collect_bam_variation(opts)`.
3. `run_collect_bam_variation(...)` owns the streaming batch/stitch/merge/write loop.
4. Read technology mode is fixed (`--hifi`, `--ont`, or `--short-reads`) and controls:
   - noisy sliding-window width,
   - ONT-only Fisher strand-bias classification path,
   - downstream parity behavior.

###### 26.2 Input Resources and Region Planning

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp` (`parse_region`, region/BED normalization, `build_region_chunks`, neighbor annotation).

5. Input alignment sources are resolved (single BAM/CRAM, list file, or primary + `-X` files).
6. FASTA index and BAM/CRAM headers are opened for coordinate and contig-name validation.
7. Region requests are normalized (CLI `chr:start-end`, BED, autosome, or full contig).
8. Regions are split into `RegionChunk` tiles (`chunk_size`, default 500k), then neighbor metadata is attached.
9. Chunks are grouped by `reg_chunk_i` so one batch corresponds to one contig stream-write unit.

###### 26.3 Output Stream Initialization

**Code path:** `collect_output.cpp` (`write_*_header`, stream setup from `collect_pipeline.cpp`).

10. Output streams are opened and headers written:
   - mandatory candidate TSV,
   - optional projected site-level VCF (`--vcf-output`),
   - optional projected phased VCF (`--phased-vcf-output`),
   - optional read-support TSV (`--read-support`),
   - optional phase-read TSV (`--phase-read-tsv`),
   - optional phased alignment output (`-S`, `-b`, `-C`), with optional refine/sort/index handling.

###### 26.4 Batch and Worker Execution Model

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp` (`collect_chunk_batch_parallel`, `WorkerContext`, fixed-slot result merge).

11. For each contig batch (`reg_chunk_i`), worker threads process chunks in parallel.
12. Each worker writes its result to a fixed slot index for deterministic post-join ordering.
13. Chunk processing itself is performed by `process_chunk(...)` -> `collect_var_main(...)`.

###### 26.5 Per-Chunk Read Loading and Digar Construction

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp::load_and_prepare_chunk`, `bam_digar.cpp` digar builders/noisy detectors.

14. For each input BAM/CRAM:
    - reads overlapping chunk bounds are loaded,
    - read-level filters are applied (`MAPQ`, duplicate/QC policy, etc.),
    - digars are built from EQX/`cs`/MD/reference comparison in `bam_digar.cpp`.
15. While digars are built, per-read noisy intervals are detected using longcallD-style sliding-window logic.
16. Reads exceeding variant/noisy density skip criteria remain present for bookkeeping but are excluded from evidence contribution.
17. Reads from all input files are pooled and deterministically sorted.

###### 26.6 Reference/Context Preparation

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp` (reference slice fetch) + `collect_var.cpp` low-complexity/noisy aggregation helpers.

18. Chunk reference sequence slice is loaded from FASTA.
19. Low-complexity intervals are computed from the reference (sdust).
20. Read-level noisy intervals are unioned into chunk noisy intervals.

###### 26.7 Candidate Discovery (Site Pass)

**Code path:** `collect_var.cpp` (`collect_all_cand_var_sites`, `collapse_fuzzy_large_insertions`).

21. Candidate SNP/INS/DEL sites are collected from non-skipped read digars.
22. Candidate keys are sorted with longcallD-compatible ordering.
23. Fuzzy large-insertion collapse is applied inside the chunk only (no cross-chunk second collapse).

###### 26.8 Candidate Evidence Counting (Depth Pass)

**Code path:** `collect_var.cpp` (`collect_allele_counts_from_records`, optional read-support emission hooks).

24. A second pass counts per-candidate support:
    - `total_cov`, `ref_cov`, `alt_cov`, `low_qual_cov`,
    - strand-specific alt/ref tallies,
    - AF and supporting per-read observation rows (if enabled).
25. This strict separation of site pass and depth pass matches longcallD structure.

###### 26.9 Noisy-Region Pre-Processing and Classification

**Code path:** `collect_var.cpp` (`pre_process_noisy_regs_pgphase`, `classify_chunk_candidates`, noisy feedback/post-process/containment).

26. Chunk noisy intervals are pre-processed (`pre_process_noisy_regs_pgphase`, the longcallD-shaped `pre_process_noisy_regs` port):
    - low-complexity extension,
    - merge by configured distance,
    - read-support-based filtering.
27. Initial category classification runs (`classify_cand_vars`-shaped path):
    - `LOW_COV`, ONT-only `STRAND_BIAS`, `LOW_AF`, `CLEAN_HOM`, repeat/noisy classes, clean het classes.
28. Dense/repeat evidence can add loci back to noisy regions.
29. Post-processing extends/merges noisy intervals around eligible nearby candidates.
30. Final containment filter marks contained candidates as `NON_VAR` when applicable.
31. `LOW_COV`, `STRAND_BIAS`, and `NON_VAR` candidates are pruned from the retained candidate table.
32. The reserved `NOISY_RESOLVED` category is not assigned by a separate large-event promotion pass in the current implementation.

###### 26.10 Step 3.1 Read Profiling

**Code path:** `collect_var.cpp::collect_read_var_profile`.

33. `collect_read_var_profile` builds per-read sparse allele vectors over candidate index ranges.
34. Matching behavior follows longcallD parity:
    - overlap check by `ovlp_var_site(...)`,
    - strict candidate identity by `exact_comp_var_site(...)`.
35. `read_var_cr` interval index is built for fast “reads covering variant i” overlap queries.

###### 26.11 Step 3.2 Initial K-Means Haplotype Assignment

**Code path:** `collect_phase.cpp::assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans`.

36. K-means-style hap assignment (`assign_hap_based_on_germline_het_vars_kmeans`) runs on clean germline categories.
37. Iterative updates assign read hap labels, variant consensus alleles, and phase-set anchors.
38. Candidate `hap_alt`/`hap_ref` are projected from `hap_to_cons_alle` with longcallD parity (`cons_alle != 0` means ALT).

###### 26.12 Step 4 Noisy-Region MSA Recall and Integration

**Code path:** `collect_phase_noisy.cpp` + `align.cpp` (noisy-region read collection, MSA/alignment strings, candidate merge/update).

39. For each finalized noisy region, Step 4 path collects clipped reference and reads.
40. Region coordinates already carry the longcallD `cr_start` semantics from the post-merge noisy-region conversion, so entry uses `noisy_reg_beg = reg.beg`.
41. Noisy alignment strings are generated via PS-aware path when both hap groups exist; otherwise no-PS path is used.
42. MSA/BALN-derived noisy candidates are generated and merged into chunk candidates.
43. Noisy profile/depth fields are updated (`total_cov` incremented per full-cover read; longcallD parity).
44. If Step 4 adds variants, read profiling and k-means are rerun with `kCandGermlineVarCate`.

###### 26.13 Mid-Free Memory Reduction

**Code path:** `collect_var.cpp::mid_free_chunk`.

45. `mid_free_chunk` releases heavy intermediates (digars, noisy trees, etc.) while preserving data required for boundary stitching.
46. This mirrors longcallD `bam_chunk_mid_free` memory discipline for multi-chunk contig processing.

###### 26.14 Contig-Level Boundary Stitching

**Code path:** `collect_phase.cpp::stitch_chunk_haps` / `flip_chunk_hap`, with optional `collect_phase_pgbam.cpp` sidecar helpers.

47. After all chunks in a contig batch finish, `stitch_chunk_haps` runs sequentially left-to-right.
48. **Optional pgbam within-chunk pass:** when `--pgbam-file` is set, `stitch_phase_blocks_with_pgbam` first merges adjacent phase blocks inside each chunk using `hs` tag thread evidence.
49. **Common-read path (primary):** boundary-spanning reads vote for no-flip/flip orientation. If `flip_score < 0`, the boundary is stitched without a hap swap; if `flip_score > 0`, it is stitched with a hap swap. In both non-zero cases candidate phase anchors are merged when anchors are finite.
50. **pgbam fallback (secondary):** when `flip_chunk_hap` returns false and `--pgbam-file` is set, the boundary phase blocks are compared with a 2x2 hap concordance matrix over polarized graph-thread support. Orientation is resolved if the winning side reaches the configured primary minimum winner threshold and neither side ties; otherwise the boundary is left unstitched.
51. **pgbam final cleanup passes:** after the common-read/pgbam adjacent sweep, optional contig-level cleanup passes can rescore all remaining phase blocks. Defaults are a margin-2/min-winner-1 cleanup followed by a relaxed margin-1/min-winner-1 cleanup; either pass and all thresholds are CLI-configurable.
52. Common-read stitching updates candidate `hap_to_cons_alle` and phase-set state, and updates read hap/phase-set state when phased alignment output is active. The pgbam merge helper updates both candidate and read state because it needs live read phase blocks for later sidecar merges.

###### 26.15 Ordered Emission

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp` batch merge + `collect_output.cpp` writers.

53. Chunk candidate tables are merged in deterministic chunk order with exact-site duplicate handling and active-region-passing duplicate preference.
54. TSV rows are emitted for all retained candidates after not-candidate pruning.
55. Optional projected VCF/phased VCF outputs emit longcallD-parity call rows only.
56. Optional read-support rows are emitted from the pre-pruning allele-count observation state.
57. Optional phase-read rows and phased alignment records are emitted from the stitched `BamChunk` state.

###### 26.16 Completion and Guarantees

**Code path:** `collect_pipeline.cpp` stream finalization and run-summary logging.

57. Streams are closed, counters/statistics are finalized, refined alignment output is coordinate-sorted if requested, BAM/CRAM output is indexed, and execution returns.
58. Deterministic sorting + fixed worker slot write-back guarantees stable output ordering across thread counts.
59. The overall design keeps candidate evidence transparent (TSV) while producing longcallD-parity projected VCF outputs for downstream interoperability.

**Source documentation:** The `collect_*` and `collect_phase` translation units (`collect_pipeline`, `collect_var`, `collect_phase`, `collect_phase_pgbam`, `collect_output`, `collect_types`) carry Doxygen-style `@file` / `@brief` / `@param` / `@return` comments so behavior matches this document at the symbol level. The introduction’s **Vendored `cgranges`** subsection explains the longcallD fork and why it is vendored; **§8** documents parity for the per-read noisy sliding window (`bam_digar` vs longcallD `xid_queue_t`); **§18.1** documents `mid_free_chunk` field-by-field parity with longcallD `bam_chunk_mid_free`; **§19** documents `stitch_chunk_haps` / `flip_chunk_hap` parity with longcallD `stitch_var_main` / `flip_variant_hap` plus optional `.pgbam` sidecar stitching. Re-vendor `src/cgranges.{c,h}` only after an intentional diff against longcallD if upstream changes.

##### 27. 2026 Strict Parity Change Log (Cross-Reference to Sections)

This section is an audit log of major parity fixes. Detailed behavior is documented in the main
pipeline sections above; this log maps each fix class to those sections.

###### 27.1 Candidate/Profile Matching and Multi-Allelic Handling

- `collect_read_var_profile` now follows longcallD matching order for germline read profiling:
  overlap by `ovlp_var_site(...)`, then strict site equality by `exact_comp_var_site(...)`.
- A C++ `ovlp_var_site` helper was ported from longcallD and used in read-profile assignment.
- For this read-profile path, insertion-specific fuzzy matching (`exact_comp_var_site_ins`) is not
  used; strict compare is used for all variant types, matching longcallD behavior at this stage.
- This fixed incorrect per-read allele assignment at same-position multi-allelic insertion sites
  (for example `C->CA` / `C->CAA` separation and downstream hap support).
- Main text: §18 Step 3.1, §26.10.

###### 27.2 Haplotype Projection Parity (`hap_to_cons_alle` -> `HAP_ALT/HAP_REF` -> `GT`)

- `collect_phase.cpp` and `collect_output.cpp` now project ALT/REF haplotypes using longcallD logic:
  any non-zero consensus allele index is treated as ALT in hap polarization (`c != 0`).
- `variant_allele_slots(...)` / `get_var_init_max_cov_allele(...)` were aligned to longcallD slot
  sizing semantics: prefer `n_uniq_alles` (when > 0), otherwise use `alle_covs.size()`.
- These changes removed incorrect `0/0` or unresolved outcomes at sites where longcallD emits phased
  ALT genotypes.
- Main text: §18 Step 3.2, §22.1, §26.11.

###### 27.3 Noisy-Region Depth/Count Semantics

- In noisy MSA profile updates (`update_cand_var_profile_from_cons_aln_str*`), `total_cov` now
  increments per full-cover read exactly as longcallD does.
- Depth finalization no longer overwrites a previously collected non-zero noisy `total_cov`.
- This aligned `DP/REFC/ALTC/LQC/AF` fields used in final category gating and VCF INFO.
- Main text: §18 Step 4, §22, §26.12.

###### 27.4 Homopolymer Indel Veto Parity

- `var_is_homopolymer_indel` in `collect_phase_noisy.cpp` was replaced with a literal longcallD port.
- Insertion homopolymer evaluation uses the VCF anchor convention (`ref_pos-1`) as in longcallD
  downstream behavior.
- This corrected false homopolymer tagging that previously suppressed phasing for valid noisy indels.
- Main text: §13.5, §18 Step 4, §26.12.

###### 27.5 Noisy MSA Alignment/Boundary Parity (`align.cpp`)

- The previous approximation path for partial alignment boundaries was removed.
- longcallD functions were ported directly: `edlib_xgaps`, `cal_wfa_partial_aln_beg_end`,
  `collect_partial_aln_beg_end`.
- In both PS and no-PS abPOA paths, cluster/read-id plumbing was aligned to longcallD:
  global read ids are passed through to abPOA helpers, and incorrect local->global remapping was removed.
- One-consensus handling now mirrors longcallD cluster population behavior.
- Main text: §18 Step 4, §26.12.

###### 27.6 Noisy Region Control-Flow/Coordinate Parity (Final 1 bp Fix)

- `collect_noisy_vars1` call order now matches longcallD:
  1) clip region via `collect_reg_ref_bseq`, then 2) collect noisy-region reads.
- Final Step 4 coordinate parity fix: finalized chunk noisy regions now use the dedicated
  `intervals_from_cr_lcd_chunk_noisy_post_merge` / `intervals_to_cr_lcd_chunk_noisy_post_merge`
  conversions, preserving longcallD `cr_start` semantics through post-processing.
- `collect_noisy_vars1` therefore enters noisy calling with `noisy_reg_beg = reg.beg`; adding another
  `-1` or `+1` at this point reintroduces 1 bp insertion-anchor drift.
- End-clip noisy-region intervals in `bam_digar.cpp` now choose `Interval` starts so the later
  `intervals_to_cr` conversion produces the same `cr_add(..., pos-1, ...)` starts as longcallD.
- Main text: §12.4, §18 Step 4, §26.12.

###### 27.7 VCF Projection and Emission Contract Parity

- Optional VCF outputs are now longcallD-style projected callsets, not candidate dumps.
- `NON_VAR`, `LOW_COV`, and `STRAND_BIAS` are pruned before TSV/VCF emission; retained candidate-only rows
  such as `LOW_AF` and `REP_HET_INDEL` remain TSV-only and are excluded from projected
  VCF call emission.
- FILTER/INFO semantics were aligned to longcallD call output behavior, including `CAT` and `CLEAN`.
- The VCF depth gate uses `total_cov` for `DP/min_depth` and `alt_cov` for `min_alt_depth`; `low_qual_cov`
  remains separate and is not added to VCF `DP`.
- Noisy indel anchors use `alt_ref_base` exactly like longcallD `make_variants`, including rejecting invalid
  non-ACGT anchor bytes before VCF output.
- Left-normalization/rotation was not retained in writer output because longcallD does not do this in
  its VCF writer path.
- Main text: §22, §22.1, §26.15.

###### 27.8 Compare Script Parity/Validation Updates

- `scripts/compare_phased_vcf.sh` now passes the selected technology mode to `pgphase`
  (`--ont` / `--hifi`) so comparisons run against the intended model.
- Multi-allelic same-position records are keyed with ALT (for non-SVLEN records), preventing false
  collapsed comparisons at shared positions.
- Main text: §24.

###### 27.9 HiFi Chr20 Strict-Parity Fixes

- VCF projection depth gates now use `total_cov` alone for `min_depth`, while classification still uses
  `total_cov + low_qual_cov` for `LOW_COV`, matching longcallD's split between `classify_var_cate` and
  `write_var_to_vcf`.
- Candidate depth sweeping now skips only `DigarType::Equal` and compares non-equal digars through a
  longcallD-shaped merge-site comparator, matching `update_cand_vars_from_digar` / `exact_comp_var_site_ins`
  behavior for non-standard digar events.
- Noisy MSA allele matching now compares `n_eq >= len * cons_sim_thres` without truncating the floating-point
  threshold to an integer.
- Final hap projection resets `hap_alt` / `hap_ref` before recomputing from `hap_to_cons_alle`, matching
  longcallD `make_variants` local-variable behavior.
- Exact duplicate candidate keys across chunks prefer rows that pass `lcd_make_variants_region_pass`, so an
  active-region CLEAN candidate is not shadowed by a neighboring noisy duplicate.
- Main text: §12.4, §18 Step 3.2, §18 Step 4, §20, §22, §26.8–§26.15.

###### 27.10 Annotated-BAM / `.pgbam` Sidecar Stitching

- The sidecar stitching implementation now lives in `collect_phase_pgbam.cpp` / `.hpp`.
- When `--pgbam-file` is provided, the regular longcallD-shaped per-chunk collection and k-means phasing run
  first. The sidecar path then merges phase blocks within each chunk and acts as a fallback for adjacent
  chunks whenever `flip_chunk_hap` returns false, while non-zero common-read boundary votes still take
  precedence.
- The sidecar path parses `hs` BAM tags, maps set IDs to graph thread IDs through `PgbamSidecarData`, scores
  adjacent phase blocks by polarized per-thread hap support, and applies flip/merge operations to candidate and
  read phase state. Primary and cleanup pass margins/min-winner thresholds are configurable from the CLI.
- Main text: §1, §18.1, §19, §19.7, §19.8, §26.14.

###### 27.11 Current Parity Status (Fixtures)

Using the repository parity script and test fixtures:

```text
bash scripts/compare_phased_vcf.sh chr11 --ont
  MATCH=400 DIFF=0 ONLY_PG=0 ONLY_LCD=0

bash scripts/compare_phased_vcf.sh chr11 --hifi
  MATCH=385 DIFF=0 ONLY_PG=0 ONLY_LCD=0
```

This is the current strict parity baseline for phased-het `GT:PS` output between `pgphase` and
longcallD on the provided `chr11` ONT/HiFi test datasets.

##### 28. Runtime Error Conditions and Guard Rails

For reproducibility, this section summarizes the primary hard-fail conditions (`std::runtime_error`)
and integrity guards enforced by the implementation. These checks are implementation behavior, not
post hoc validation.

###### 28.1 Input and Region Validation Failures

- Invalid region syntax or malformed BED lines terminate execution.
- Regions whose contig names are absent from BAM headers or FASTA index terminate execution.
- Region chunking requires indexed BAM/CRAM input; missing indexes terminate execution.
- Empty BAM/CRAM list files terminate execution.

###### 28.2 I/O and Resource Initialization Failures

- Failure to open BAM/CRAM inputs, read headers, or inspect alignment format terminates execution.
- Non-BAM/CRAM alignment inputs terminate execution.
- Failure to load/build FASTA index terminates execution.
- CRAM reference binding failures (`hts_set_fai_filename`) terminate execution.
- Output stream creation failures (TSV, VCF, phased VCF, read-support TSV, phase-read TSV when requested)
  terminate execution.

###### 28.3 Per-Chunk Processing Failures

- BAM iterator creation failure for a chunk terminates execution.
- BAM record duplication failure during read loading terminates execution.
- Invalid chunk batch range in parallel batch orchestration terminates execution.

###### 28.4 Stitching Integrity Guards

Chunk-boundary stitching enforces strict overlap pairing invariants:

- mismatch in aggregate overlap read counts between adjacent chunks,
- mismatch in per-list j-th pairing cardinality,
- out-of-bounds overlap read indices.

Any violation terminates execution rather than continuing with ambiguous boundary phasing state.

###### 28.5 Internal Assertions

Internal `assert(...)` checks are present in alignment/noisy helper code paths (for example,
cover-state consistency and expected allele-width assumptions). In debug/assert-enabled builds,
violations terminate execution immediately; in release builds these assertions may be compiled out,
while explicit runtime checks listed above remain active.
